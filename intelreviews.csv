3,The heat is hot,Super hot CPU. Investing in this means investing in serious cooling for it.
3,Memory controller isn't that great,It's no secret that the memory controller is a lottery on this and 13th gen cpus. It's very flaky.7200mhz XMP profiles are unstable. 4 sticks of RAM is unstable.Other than that the CPU does its job. It's basically just a binned 13900ks. Nothing special.
4,A Monster CPU with One Major Caveat,"I built PC with the new Intel i9-14900k, and I must say, it's a beast of a processor. Coming from an i7-8700k, the performance boost is nothing short of incredible. Multitasking, gaming, and content creation have all seen a significant improvement. Multithreaded applications and gaming experiences run smoother.  It's a productivity powerhouse. The clock speeds are no slouch either, making it excellent for single-threaded tasks and gaming. The major downside of this CPU is the heat it generates. Even with a high-end cooling solution, it tends to run hot, and that's something you must take into consideration when setting up your cooling solution. Be ready for this CPU to draw a significant amount of power at full load. It can put quite a load on your power supply and might necessitate an upgrade if you're not already prepared. The Intel i9-14900k is an incredible processor, and the upgrade from an i7-8700k is substantial. Its exceptional performance in various tasks justifies its price tag. If you're willing to address these challenges, you'll be rewarded with a fantastic computing experience."
4,This is thing is super hot.,"May be a little excessive and unnecessary, but glad I got one when I did.  Sometimes these things get hard to acquire, especially at a decent price.Seems to run a little hotter than my Ryzen 9 7950X, so I went with dual 420mm,  If you buy this CPU you should really consider custom loops or large cases with 420mm AIO support."
4,"great cpu, not as powerful as I thought it would be","great cpu, not as powerful as I thought it would be. Ended up going with a 14700k, just seemed a bit laggy even when running at  5.8 all core.. great cpu though and runs cool"
4,Recomendado!!!,Perfecto para las tareas m? demandantes y los juegos m? pesados en cuesti? de rendimiento en pocas palabras perfecto para gaming y programas pesadosSe lleva muy bien con una RTX 4090 24 GbPi?salo bien en cuesti? de rendimiento
4,Fast and Lots of Cores,"I write code for a living and this CPU builds my code 5.7 times faster than my prior (6th gen) development machine.  I'm really happy about that.  Plus it can run 32 concurrent threads which means I can easily host multiple VMs.  Nice!  Only downside of this CPU, for me, is no VROC (RAID in CPU) support."
5,"5.0 out of 5 stars
i9 14th gen is the beast!","Just upgraded from i5 9400f to i9 14900k and super happy with the performance that I am able to achieve. It simply works buttery smooth. Large applications open like notepad apps.It heats a lot though so I went with MSI coreliquid liquid cooling solution.If looking to upgrade from 13th gen then save money because the performance is identical, however if setting up new PC then definitely go with it.My setup -MSI MPG z790 carbon wifiIntel i9 14900kMSI RTX 4070tiMSI MAG coreliquid liquid coolerSamsung 980 Pro - 1 TBRipjaws 32gb ddr5Bonus tip: If u are struck setting up ur PC then go to MSI support and they are super responsive to assist you. I got my wiring fixed in matter of minutes ona video call by their assistant."
5,Buen procesador,"Buen procesador que te da para poder jugar y realizar trabajos de ofimática, renderización de video, etc"
5,Cool,bonne decision pour mon ordi

5,Arrived fast,Fast shipping. Works as advertised.
5,Excelente procesador top de lo top,"Lo compré con el 10% de descuento, es el mejor procesador que he tenido. No llora con nada, que es muy caliente, si. Pero con una buena refrigeración liquida, que ya son bastante buenas, se controla.Me gustó mucho, sin demeritar a la competencia AMD que lo está haciendo genial también. Per en mi caso como las memorias DDR5 vienen optimizadas para intel y no quiero estar batallando, me decidí por este y no me arrepiento de mi compra. Muy buen producto de calidad premium."
5,Fast,Used for 3D rendering. Solid and fast. I am very happy with this cpu.
1,No era nuevo,"El producto era de importación, entiendo que pudieran haber abierto la caja, pero llegó incluso con restos de pasta térmica, por lo que debió haber sido usado o era uno que regresaron. La incógnita de no saber que tanto estrés se le metió al procesador antes de enviarlo es complicada, cuando se esperaba un producto nuevo.Actualización: El procesador en efecto venía dañado, el primero problema fue que impedía la instalación de Windows. La forma de verificar la falla fue entrando a la BIOS y desactivando todos los cores, a posterior fui activando uno por uno. Con un solo núcleo permitió instalar Windows, el resumen fue: todos los E-cores funcionaban, de los P-Cores estaban dañados el 4, 6 y 7 ya que al encender cualquiera de esos tres desde la BIOS, generaba pantallas azules, se freezeaba o cerraba programas aleatoriamente.No descarto que el tema haya sido un problema de fábrica, pero desde que llegó con pasta térmica en los bordes, me hacía sospechar que había algo malo con el procesador, ya se realizó la solicitud de reembolso."
1,AVOID THIS PROCESSOR AT ALL COSTS / 13th/14th gen Intel i7-i9 issues,"Where do I begin... In between the stability issues this causes, the blue screens of death, the fact that you can't run even Minesweeper due to the problems this processor causes, the ""lack of video resources"" not caused by the GPU but rather by the CPU, the constant need for undervolting of a so-called high end chip, the overheating of the processor, the fact that Intel stayed quiet about this and STILL hasn't taken any action so far, that so many customers have been forced to ask for returns, or the fact that this was hushed for so long that it'll be a miracle to get a refund... Disappointment is still too light a term to refer to what went on with these processors. Honestly, this already falls within a product recall territory, and it's both a scam and an insult to every potential customer out there."
1,Defective from manufacturer constant game crashes because of power throttle issue.,Defective from manufacturer constant game crashes because of power throttle issue. Intel needs to recall this product and refund everyone.  I replaced every part on my new PC build only to find out the issues was this Intel CPU (amazon 30 day warranty had already expired by then).  I'm now having to wait for months attempting to get a refund from intel.  This is a well-known issue and Intel refuses to admit and recall product
1,A Carefully Engineered Nightmare,"I'm a game developer and decided to switch from AMD to Intel for my latest build. The amount of problems this CPU has caused me has cost me hundreds of hours of work. I've been building computers for over 20 years and this is by far the absolute worst component of all time. E cores will cause instability in almost every multithreaded application, clocking has to be severely limited to avoid blue screen of death, Intel Extreme Tuning Utility is borderline malware, and the high thread count is just deceptive marketing because 1/3 of the cores are laptop grade. It gave the illusion of stability through the return period so I'm now stuck with a $500 paper weight CPU and motherboard."
1,"Absolute scam, stay away!","This CPU is a scam. I spent four months debugging my new system, went through three motherboards, two sets of RAM and countless hours of debugging and trying, just to figure out that this CPU is garbage. I can't get my system stable, it keeps failing. This CPU is so overclocked that it does not run stable. Ever. Safe your money, times and nerves and stay as far away from this CPU as you can. I will never buy Intel again."
1,Lost me as a customer,"I?ve always used Intel, as my experiences with AMD have never been great. Wanted to upgrade from my 8700K as I?m doing a lot more rendering/3D work and I need the extra cores and performance. I thought I did my due diligence and picked out ram that was compatible with my motherboard, a suitable CPU cooler, etc to ensure a smooth upgrade.Ultimately was met with so much instability, crashes, high power usage and heat. The instability seemed incurable so I returned everything and switched to the 7950x3d? and it just worked straight out of the box, runs so much cooler and less power draw, with no crashes. It?s not as fast as the 14900k in my tasks, but the other benefits out weigh the decrease in performance."
1,Unstable chips,Ive tried both 13900k and 14900 k and have had issues with everything crashing games applications. I have changed multiple motherboard?s and ram kits very unstable. Dont recommend and or wish this stressful and painful struggle to anyone. I have tried many things and nothing absolutely nothing works
1,Tribal packaging,Products work well but runs very hot. Tribal packaging tho the only Protection was a piece of crumpled paper. The cpu wasn't even in the packaging it had folen out and was just tumbling around the box when it arrived. luckily didn't have any noticeable damage though
1,Incredibly unstable,"Intel has pushed these 13th and 14th Gen i9's way too far in an effort to keep up with AMD. They come out of the box with maxed out settings, including a nearly unlimited 5000w (yes, thousand) available power draw. Intel customer support will ask you to manually configure the BIOS to a setting that effectively renders it a very expensive i7. Wait until they get this fixed, if it's even possible, unless you just really like underclocking and BSODs"
1,SO MANY PROBLEMS,This CPU is a piece of garbage. Can?t run most games without special settings that are all different from each other depending on the game. Don?t buy this worthless CPU. Was better off sticking with my 10th gen I7
5,Processore eccezionale,"processore al top, davvero stupefacente.Non a buon mercato, ma se servono prestazioni questo è il processore giusto."
5,El mejor procesador del momento,"Muy buen procesador, pero necesita una buena refrigeracion."
5,Running air cooled on DeepCool Assassin IV with ease,"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen."
5,excelente producto,Excelente velocidad I9 14900k en verdad me sorprendio lo recomiendo
5,6.2GHZ 8200mts cl38 Daily Driver.,"This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailers?Best Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fans?Avoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouse?achieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methods?increased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this date?4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.  Just having fun, do what you love!I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar!Note:Settings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours.  I can get bus latency down to under 50NS but need to decrease core clock to locked 5.8GHZ to stay at safe voltage....  Depends what needs done, either/or is screaming fast even 55ns at that Bandwidth."
5,Klasse Steigerung vom 12900kf !,"Der Intel i9-14900K ist eine beeindruckende Weiterentwicklung des i9-12900KF.Der spürbare Leistungsanstieg, den ich erfahren habe, ist beachtlich und zeigt die Fortschritte in der Technologie.Die Kombination mit der Asus Apex Encore und dem schnellen 7200 MHz Arbeitsspeicher liefert super  Ergebnisse, immerhin  konnte ich 41.000 Punkte im Cinebench R23 ohne Übertaktung erreichen.Die Kombination bietet eine solide Grundlage für anspruchsvolle Aufgaben und Gaming.Man sollte jedoch beachten , dass die genaue Leistung je nach Anwendung variieren kann.Insgesamt scheint der i9-14900K eine lohnende Investition zu sein, selbst wenn man vorher im Besitz der 12. Generation war."
5,Powerful but Warm,"Before you purchase this CPU please also purchase alongside of it purchase a 360 AiO as well, this CPU is in need of it. I'm not trying to say that to scare you but it runs warm. In my (asus) bios I turned on ""Disabled-Enforce all limits"" so that the motherboard doesn't try to do on the fly OC to keep temps low and stability up. I haven't had any crashes or stability issues at all. I did a full platform upgrade from the 10900k to this, I kept my RTX 3080 and the performance bump was actually fully noticeable. I'd say my average temperature for doing basic computing is around 37c with my Lian Li Galahad II Trinity 360. It's a monster of a CPU genuinely and if you are in the market for an upgrade don't hesitate you won't regret it."
5,El GOAT,"De los mejores procesadores del mercado. Excelente para cualquier tipo de tarea exigente. Pero es importante combinarlo con una buena refrigeración líquida o tendrá cuello térmico.Tuve que pedirlo 2 veces porque el primero tenía un error de hardware muy común en estos procesadores, un problema en la compilación de shaders que crashea en algunos juegos o programas. El segundo que pedí llegó sin ningún problema."
5,Best cpu,"The Intel i9-14900K delivers impressive performance with its high clock speeds and advanced architecture. It excels in demanding tasks like gaming, content creation, and multitasking, offering smooth and responsive performance. The integrated graphics are decent for light gaming and multimedia tasks. However, it's power-hungry and may require robust cooling solutions. Overall, it's a top choice for enthusiasts and power users seeking uncompromising performance."
1,Unstable Out Of The Box.,"Installed on an Asus Z790 Hero motherboard, the system was unstable when attempting to undervolt the CPU, and tweaking settings never stabilized it. Hopefully, Intel will release more stable silicon in their next generation."
1,Was a loyal intel consumer until this.,Brand new chip doesnt even work. Howd are these for sale? Returned this. Amazon received this almost one month ago and still hasnt issued a refund.
1,Died after 4 months,"It's fast, but it's not great for quality"
1,Windows install wants a network but no network is listed,"While you are installing windows, when you get stuck on finding a network but no networks are listed and it won't let you continue. This is because Windows 11 doesn't support your built in LAN/Wi-Fi drivers.The solution for this is to hitShift+F10 which will bring up the command prompt window. From here you typeOOBE\BYPASSNRO which will re-enable the ""I don't have internet"" option.This will let you continue installing windows.Now you can troubleshoot your network from windows."
1,Not sure what CPU I received,I received a processor in an Intel I box.No markings on the processor itself. Thermal paste residue still on the processor.  This is crazy!!!
1,Inaccurate listing,"The listing for this product claims that you don't need a discrete graphics card. This is incorrect, the KF model does not bring an onboard graphics card. This wasted my time and slowed down the timeline for my NAS build by 3 whole days. Thanks."
1,"Trash quality control, trash memory controller","Quality/silicon control on 14700k is chaos. What the hell intel thinking and doing I dont know.My 13600KF took 7400mhz ram like champ, while this thing cant get even 6800mhz stable... Very dissapointed.1.35v 300w in cinebench with 100c temps with arctic freezer 280mm (that beats most of 360mm AIOs) + bending corrector and good paste.TRASH."
1,Do not buy,This thing is a total scam from the i9 13900k or kf. Its literally the same thing. The advertise that its goes up to 6000hz but thats only on two cores of course and only when you dont need them do they go that high. I had higher cinebench scores on my i9 13900kf then I did on this processor. Its the same thing just overclocked out of the box. Save your money
1,Faulty,Faulty cpuThey arent properly tested before shippingPc booted into windows but couldnt handle any intensive tasks unless a dedicated gpu wasnt installed
5,Works great,My husband built me a computer from scratch because my old one was to slow for him. The I7 was the last thing I needed. It was easy for him to install. It performs fantastic.
5,Use a good cooling system - I've got it under a 240 AIO with Diamond paste,I upgraded from an i9 - 11900K.  Pretty good performance increase on benchmarks.  I haven't gamed on it yet (still in the process of locking down cables and loose hardware)MB GIGABYTE Z790 AORUS PRO X
5,This is a Beast,"Case: GOPIE Micro ATX Case T07 (branded as ABIT on the case)Motherboard: MSI MAG B760m Mortar WIFI IICPU: I9 14900kCPU Cooler: ID-COOLING SE-207-XT SlimDDR5: 64Gb T-Team Create Expert 6000Mhz (4 x 32Gb)3 x m.2 Gen4: Lexar - 1 x 512GB (OS)/1 x 1TB/1 x 2TBSSD: 1 x 4TB CrucialCase Fans: Thermalright TL-9015B CPU Cooler Fan 92mm (2 x Intake Bottom/2 x Exhaust Top/1 x Exhaust rear)PSU: Montech Century Mini 750w GoldGPU: N/AThe I9 14900k is a beast and runs hot. While doing benchmarks, a few Pcores would hit 100c while others would hit 92c. Ecores was about 87c and low of 83c on 4.3Ghz all Pcore and 4.2Ghz all Ecore. Offset voltage was at 0.3. After switching back to auto clock, I still managed the same temps, but getting 5.1-5.2Ghz on Pcore and 4.3 on Ecore. If my case allowed 120mm fans, I would of most definitely installed 240mm AIO cooler. That for sure would of helped with the temps and get me higher benchmark numbers.When it came to rendering a 20 minute 4k video on sony Vegas Pro 18 (IGPU only), it took about 15 minutes to complete it vs my I9 9900k that would of taken over an hour to finish it (RTX 3060). This system was meant specifically VR/light video editing. So, considering how fast it is on the rendering without a dedicated GPU, I am pretty excited about it. I haven't tried the VR aspect yet.Overall, if you are coming from a few gen older CPU and want to upgrade to the 14900k, you wont be disappointed."
5,Much fast,Able to compile rust code way faster now.
5,Fast and good,Ooohhhhh boy this is fast and secksy. Maybe the women will love me long time for buying mmmmmm boy Im insecure
5,Scores well with cinebench,Like the idea of no onboard video heating up the processor.  The irony is i have a Asus pro art MB 750 model that does the integration of components. My station is primarily used as a work station though it scores well with PC Mark 10 and cinebench. 3D Mark declares the obvious that I need to upgrade my video card from several years ago. The ai over clocking helps in the bench marking significantly. Lot easier to overclock than in the early 2000's on my core 2quad. Enjoying my thermal right air cooler it does a great job for half the cost of my older noctua cooler on my prior haswell i7.
5,AMAZING BEAST,AMAZING AND RECEIVED SO QUICK! <3
5,I9 14th Gen nest CPU on market !!!!,This CPU is a absolute monster.  Period.  i love it .  i have it paired with a 4080 super.  Any new game i can usually pull 300 fps on any game!
5,Even Microsoft was impressed,"I had some issues after install with Windows wanting me to buy it over again. While I was on with Microsoft tech support even they were like, ""that's a heck of a setup""..."
5,Better than 13th gen,"I previously purchased the 13th Gen version of this processor and it had a defect. Intel was very good at getting a refund sent via RMA, although it took awhile. I purchased this version instead and was pleasantly surprised to see all of my issues resolved. The CPU can handle almost everything thrown at it. Certainly a good purchase and better than the 13th gens that seem to have more issues."
5,Disgustingly Powerful.,"Words truly cannot express how powerful, but also how hot this cpu is. After upgrading from a Ryzen 3700x to this, my work speed, gaming, everything cannot lay a finger on this thing. The only time's i've seen this truly cap out is during extreme compression, decompression, and specific rendering situations. The only con which isn't truly a con is that this chip can get incredibly HOT. If you're going to get this? I would absolutely suggest a 360 AIO cooler or you're going to experience thermal throttling, or even thermal shutdowns. That was my original issue, but quickly upgraded coolers, and this thing is a MONSTER."
5,So easy to install a baby could do it!,"No more lining up pins, now you just make sure this thing sits in the way it belongs and off you go! I've had an H170i on it the whole time but it barely gets into the 40's when under extreme load. For the price, the 14700KF is the way to go imho"
5,It's the perfect fit for this monster PC I just built.,"A lot of people are upset with the 14900k because of the minimal performance leap thar came between it and the 13900k. I say who cares. If you have a 13900k, don't upgrade, but if you have an older PC or 12th Gen, this is a worthy upgrade. I absolutely love mine. It's a monster of a CPU.I honestly don't recommend air cooling it. It can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits (which most people don't know how to do, let alone even know what that means)If you're not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k, I recommend you do what I've done to cool mine, you dont neeeed to, but it helps. I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator. That means I have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator, and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case. Both are blowing upward. It creates more airflow. One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap. It might say 12th/13th Gen but it will also work on 14th Gen. So get an AIO, setup a push-pull fan configuration and get a contact frame. It's helping my Temps significantly. I typically stay in the high 50's or low 60's during 4K gaming. This CPU draws a ton of power so you might see it bump up to 80° occasionally, for a very brief moment. (Maybe 1 second or less)"
5,Runs HOT - Get a good cooler!,"I paired this with a ""GIGABYTE Z790 Eagle AX LGA 1700 Intel Z790 ATX Motherboard with DDR5, M.2, PCIe 5.0, USB 3.2 Gen2X2 Type-C, Intel Wi-Fi 6E, 2.5GbE LAN, Q-Flash Plus, EZ-Latch"" mobo and TGDGAMER ""T-240MM Black ARGB Liquid CPU Water Cooling with 240mm ARGB PWM Fan, Temperature Display, Computer Water Cooling"". The Intel application used AI to tweak my CPU to squeeze out more performance, but under 100% load it will often thermally throttle and sporadically hit 100C. I am considering finding a better cooler to keep up with this racehorse."
5,"Seems fine, though I never got to use it.","Didn't get to use this because the motherboard I ordered with it was D.O.A. Not the seller's fault, of course. I ended up refunding."
5,GET THE 14700K,"I have used this for my build and 3 others, didn't realize what the F is for...Get the K, it's not much more and worth the extra. That being said, this beast will do everything you want it to do and more."
5,very good,i like it
5,Very fast Cpu,Must have 360mm water cooler for this cpu it runs very hot fast! My 260mm wasnt enough to cool it down at all while gaming!
5,Powerful CPU!,"This CPU is POWERFUL! It ran smoother and was able to open/load programs much faster than my Ryzen 7 5700G. Had no issues cooling this beast of a CPU with a 280mm AiO. If money wasnt an issue for me, I would definitely buy another 14900K just to keep as a little souvenir hahaha."
5,bueno,por la compra del procesador decía que regalaban un juego  no veo ningún código de canjede resto Intel es Intel lo mejor del mercado
5,The beast! Be prepared to cool it!,It's the current Intel flagship desktop CPU.We had to upgrade from 120mm to 240mm liquid coolers for it.IMPORTANT NOTE: You may need to manually set the max power and max amps in the bios. There's currently an issue that causes them to be set to insanely high values (4096W) by default causing the chip to become unstable under heavy loads.
5,i7 14700k es bueno no calienta mucho,no calineta mucho pero utilizo un radiador 360 corsair
5,Great product!,"New, great product, came as described and very fast at the same day!"
5,Thank you.,I love it.
5,So far so good.,"Sorta came from a 13900k but I gave that to a relative after their x299/i9-7940x system began to have issues. He bought a z790 board and was amazed how far ahead the 13900k is in comparison an overclocked Skylake-X processor. He fixed the issue with the x299 system, but he decided to stay with Raptor Lake. All of which is okay by me because that old 13900k had no overclocking headroom, and I could only undervolt it by 5mv before it became unstable. I was going to buy another 13900k or maybe the ks version, but I decided to wait for the 14900k.The 14900k I got on the other hand has some overclocking headroom. I already set all P-cores to 5.8GHz, while keeping the double-core Turbo Boost at 6.0GHz. I also set the cache to 5.2Ghz and it's completely stable. I was not able to raise the multiplier at all with my 13900k. Just happy my 14900k isn't a lottery loser.While the clock of both the 13900ks and 14900k are the same, the 13900ks has a cherry picked memory controller. If you're looking to do a ton of RAM overclocking then the 13900ks may be the way to go.... but that's not to say if you'd get a 14900k with a good memory controller. Both my 13900k and 14900k work with DDR5-7200 RAM with XMP set, and no adjustments to the memory controller voltages.If you're buying the 14900k off the get-go and building a new system around it, then I recommend pairing it with a motherboard that has the BIOS Flashback feature."
5,Lightening fast.,"My benchmark is almost at 14k now with without overclocking.nVidia GTX 1080, 65gb 6400 ram and 2gb PCIE5 SSD, Gigabyte Z790 Elite x wifi7 motherboard.I won't need to change this setup for the next decade or so like I did with my last PC.Worth the money, but you'll need the right SSD to go with it."
5,This is a BEAST and runs hot.  But that's OK!,"Even you're getting hotter temps despite having great cooling, it's normal for this CPU.  It's a beast.  I recommend using a triple-fan-radiator AIO cooler to keep this bad boy as cool as possible. And make sure to blow the hot air OUT of your PC case."
5,Can you say SCREAM!,"This is the first time I've ever went for it and got an i9. I usually stick to the i7. I am so glad I decided to take the chance because this thing screams. To think that I can also squeeze out more by overclocking is just insane. Every application I've ran is so snappy and responsive. Being an impatient human, this thing makes me happier every time I turn it on. Power and Speed are right where I like it. This chip is just so damn sweet!"
5,Great performance,"This is an excellent, stable CPU. Care must be taken to keep it cool. It is a hot running CPU. To avoid heat throttling at 100deg Celsius in heavy duty gaming or testing, order a high end liquid cooler. For professional work and easy gaming a big block fan cooler will be just fine as it is much more quiet. To save a little  money, if at all, the I9-13900K will work just as well performance wise."
5,it works,Works - what else is needed?  a little expensive.
5,Powerful processor,"Not sure what more to say other than it's crazy powerful.  Make sure you have a high watt power supply to go with this and all the devices you plan to run with this.  And really don't go small on the CPU cooler.  This thing is good at figuring out when to throttle down.  You'll get it's best performance with a large aio water cooler.  If you can build your own water cooling system, better.Also, make sure your mobo manufacturer have  all the drivers available to work smoothly with these lines of processors."
5,Well packaged and performed perfectly,"No issues with this seller or product, but for those that are looking for a new PC part the 14900 k is merely a refinement over the 13900k which you may be able to find cheaper."
5,Gaming God,"The media could not be loaded.
                



This beauty does exactly what it says, super fast overclocking her to 6 GHz run smooth."
5,Excellent,"I had a minor hiccup with my new 14900KF, but I contacted Intel and their customer service was fantastic. They sent me a new one and it's working great now. This thing is like a buzz saw in gaming. I have a negative offset on the voltage of -0.0500v and the hottest I've seen it get was 62c while playing Horizon Zero Dawn maxed at 4K. It was getting as high as 190 FPS every now and then. This CPU is brutal man. Top flight customer service too."
5,Ultimate with 4090oc.,PERFECT!  EASIER to install than I thought as a first time processor install for me.WORTH WHILE performance increase from my (also good 12700). And helped unleash the power of my 4090oc GPU.
5,Perfecto,"The media could not be loaded.
                



Perfecto, es un i9 no se puede decir m?"
5,"Rock stable, Fast clock speeds, basically like buying the silicon lottery for a 13900K/KS","It's a Raptor Lake refresh CPU. If you have a 13900K you don't need this. Unless you are an extreme over clocker or need every possible MHZ per thread and stability. If you have a 13900KS you really don't need this CPU.If you have a 12th Gen, it might be worth it to you if you need that extra performance but really depends on what you do.If you are on 11th Gen or below and were looking to upgrade, you might as well get a 14700K or 14900K or KF as they are similarly priced with the 13th gen processors.Also, the 14700K has a 4 more E cores and higher clock speeds which can result in 10-20% performance gains depending on the workload compared to the 13700K.Otherwise wait for the next generation of CPUs to make the leap."
5,"Very happy with 14900K, the reviews are misleading. It's feels way better then they say it performs.","This CPU is amazing. Feels like magic. I have it running in an Asrock PG Sonic 700 series, with 32GB GSkill DDR5 7200, and a Crucial T700 2TB PCIe 5.0 SSD and Cooler Master Masterliquid Atmos 360. Anytime u do anything, even click a icon the cpu jump up to 6Ghz. And for me stay under 30C Idle and under 70C Max Load. Never mind what temperatures it runs at, I can't get it to throttle. Seems like all of its power is available on demand all the time. And I'm basically computing in Real Time. The 13900K was fast, significantly faster then the 12900K, and this CPU even though on paper it doesnt look like they did much, and in benchmarks it looks close, it still feels like 15-20% faster the 13900K when your using it. I feel like it runs cooler then the 13900K, the 13900K was the hot chip. I don't know how they do it. Like I said it's like magic how it stays at 6GHz and stays so cool."
5,It? a beast,Currently playing Battlefield 2042 with this beast and it? silk smooth even paired with a 1080ti
5,Ye,CPU runs at max 65 C. Seems good to me.
5,Powerful cpu for gaming,"Love the processor, got it new and using with a rtx 4090 for 1440p. Have it paired with a z690 formula board and I have the ai optimize the cpu. On a 420 cooler it gets 60c at best with warzone 3 with 240 fps. Fast and consistent,  on a 240 cooler Temps got up to 71-81c keep that in mind. Love my purchase!"
5,Hot,Runs hot but runs very well needs a good good good cooler
5,Can't argue with results,"Intel has always worked better for me than competition. I feel like reviewers benchmarks may not be realistic to a typical PC setup. I'm getting 620Fps at 1440P in Rainbow Six Siege on a 4090 ROG Strix OC. Yes at this framerate my fans do spin fast and are loud, but I limit the frames to 143 and then it is quiet and the fans hardly spin.Case: Corsair 4000DGPU : Asus ROG STRIX 4090 OCCPU : Intel Core i9-14900KPSU : MSI MPG A1000G PCIE 5 ATX 3.0Cooler : ARCTIC Liquid Freezer II 280Fans : 4x Antec PF12 SeriesStorage : 2X SAMSUNG 990 PRO SSD 4TB  870 EVO 4TB 2.5 InchMemory : 64GB 2x32 Corsair Vengeance 5600MHz CL40 XMPNote: I would not recommend the cooler for this case and MB combo Heatsink on MB blocks cooler which doesn't properly screw in totally."
5,Intel has made a really fast CPU,"I like the CPU because of the speed and easy install with no problems.  I use two 140 Cooler Master radiator fans to keep the unit cool. I totally rebuilt my computer with a Asus Rog 790Z board, 5 M.2  drives. I get a total boot up in 15 Seconds. I use the unit for Data, Video and music.  I've used intel chips and Asus Boards for over 30 years and never had a problem.  With this package I get instant access to all my files. Very happy with my purchase."
5,Great Processor!,I build it my new editing PC and use this 14th generation processor (24 cores and 32 threads).
5,I like it.,Runs at a good temp with a kraken 360 elite.
5,Great cpu,"The i7 14700KF isn't just a CPU; it's a beast unleashed. This 20-core powerhouse purrs like a kitten under normal workloads, staying surprisingly cool thanks to its 7nm architecture. But don't be fooled by its initial demeanor  this CPU is a wolf in sheep's clothing, ready to tear through any demanding games and content creation tasks with ease, I paired with an rx 7900 xtx and forgot about frame rate drops and stuttering."
5,Great performance. Lots of heat,Great performance. Lots of heat.
5,High TDP and Temperatures,"A very powerful processor, but if it does not have good cooling, its functions will be limited. Currently it is working wonders together with the other components. But if they have a moderate cooling system, it is advisable to use the other brand of processors ""AMD"" that has half the temperatures, but with 10% to 20% less performance in some activities, and with the defects that come with not have an architecture that self-protects well or do not update its software often for better handling.Finally, I recommend the processor, only if you have a processor that does not meet current needs. My I7 6700k can do it all, but for some specific technologies, such as SSD Gen 4, peripherals with high-speed USB - C and others, it couldn't cope."
5,"Runs hot, get a good cooler!","Awesome CPU thing can handle anything and everything for at least my needs as a gamer, and programmer! HIGHLY SUGGEST getting a 360 AIO or a custom water loop, and a CPU bracket if you are getting this CPU. It run's very hot getting a CPU bracket cut down my temps about 5-10 degrees. I'm not sure how good air coolers are for this CPU but I've seen a lot of people not suggest it. I use a 360 AIO Loop and it works great at keeping this thing cool!"
5,Highly recommended,"The media could not be loaded.
                



Works well on my new PC"
5,Performs!,"Does as intended. Topped the stock benchmark stats. It's a heater but the I9s are the top performs. Recommend no smaller than a 360 cooler, I went Artic due to the increased width of their radiator core. Top temp (tuned) 95c but will play most games in the 65c range. VR put a greater heat of 91c max but the flight sim was beautiful and smooth as can be with water takeoffs and landings. This was an upgrade to a 12700kf that I chose awaiting the 14 generation processors. I have this combined with a Nvidea 4080 on a MSI z690 board with 64gb ddr4.  Smooth gaming."
5,Rápido y con buena atención,El producto llego antes de los esperado y en buenas condiciones. Lo cual se agradece mucho. Estare probando en los próximos días
5,Super fast,I really enjoy the speed of this processor. IO would definitely use this again on another build. Didn't rate the gaming because I am not a gamer but I would expect it would be great for that as well.
5,Careful shipment,Everything was great
5,"Great so far, one gen newer with no real improvements.",It was either this one or the 13th gen. I went with this one for the few extra bucks to stay up to date with things longer. Works great so far with no issues.
5,Very good CPU for work use.,"This CPU is for work use. It is very stable at stock speeds. It worked great right out of the box. I doubt if I will ever have to think about it again. I recommend it for real world use. As for gaming, I just can't say how it would perform."
5,Power,"The i9 14900K is undoubtedly a very powerful CPU!Just for gaming I wouldn't recommend, for gaming and working, YES!Also, think about a GOOD COOLING solution (custom watercooler, cryo,...) and/or undervolting (depends on MoBo).A regular 360mm AIO has a hard time keeping this CPU cool!"
5,"Aparentemente es un buen procesador, pero, no ha funcionado en mi placa madre","Este producto fue comprado en base a la información técnica de compatibilidad de INTEL y ASUS para la placa madre ASUS ROG Maximus Z690 Hero. Sin embargo, NO funciona, el sistema operativo no arranca. Se hicieron todas las pruebas sugeridas por ASUS, pero, simplemente NO funciona. Es más, se cambió a un nuevo procesador i9-14900KF y dió los mismos resultados, NO funciona. Aún estoy esperando respuesta de ASUS (2023-12-08). Si alguien tiene la misma placa madre y el mismo procesador, agradecería su sugerencia.Nota: la placa madre ASUS ROG Maximus Z690 Hero funciona perfectamente con procesador i9-12900KF"
5,"Great  buy, when on sale",This is a great processor and when on sale it is by far the best value out there!
5,Great CPU,"Decided to go Intel over AMD and this cpu will not disappoint you. Id recommend looking into the E-Core and Pcore information before you buy, havent noticed any issue with it but still a nuisance"
5,came from a 12600k,upgraded from a 12600kf and 3080 10gb and went to this 14700kf and 4070 ti super and its great. added 60-70fps on a lot of games.
5,Absolutely a monster CPU.,"Fast.Runs cool and sips power at idle, guzzles down power when under heavy render load. Gaming is average load and power. Can't complain.More than 6 or 8 cores, won't be limited in the future.Very Fast.Intel APO for 14th gen is a neat new feature which can greatly improve gaming performance.Stable.Memory trains fast and is stable even when pushed well above XMP.Not cheap? But also not expensive for the amount of cores and performance.Would recommend."
5,Pretty good CPU but gets hot.,Upgraded from a 13700k and it is noticeably faster but not a huge upgrade.  Only went with the 14900k as it will be the last CPU I will need to buy for at least 3 years.
5,Ein wahres Rechenmonster,"Sagenhafte Performance. Aber man sollte unbedingt eine Wasserkühlung nutzen, mit einem Prozessorlüfter läuft man sehr schnell Gefahr dass der Prozessor wegen Überhitzung drosselt."
5,20 Cores with 28 Logical processors,"This CPU is extremely good. Base speed is 3.40 GHz overclocking speed is 5.6 GHz. L1 cache is 1.8 MB, L2 cache is 28 MB and L3 is 33 MB. Handles most CPU intensive games really well."
5,Great CPU for the price,"4 more efficiency cores than 13700K for about the same price! If you worried about the heat and power draw, go into the BIOS and set the CPU max power draw to 253W which is the max power draw from Intel's website. By setting CPU max power draw to 253W in BIOS, my temperature went from 93c down to 82c in Cinebench 2024 stress test. Actually only draws 60-70w when I game. Most of the time you will not use all the CPU cores so don't worry about power draw."
5,Bester Prozessor,"Der Prozessor ist zwar recht teuer und wir favorisieren immer noch Intel anstelle anderer Hersteller. Die Installation des Prozessors war extrem einfach und er liefert genau die Performance, die wir uns erhofft haben. Da ist jetzt erst einmal wieder für die nächsten Jahre Ruhe."
5,Alles ok,Alles ok gerne wieder danke
5,Fast and not as hot as expected,Speeds are great in all benchmarks and real world workflows. Obviously overkill for gaming. Paired with a 360 AIO it stays at great temps.I tried a 7950x build but literally no combo of ram and motherboard would result in stability and the boot would take absurdly long despite memory context restore/power down disabled. I popped this in and immediately all my problems went away. Fast boot times and stability!
5,"5.0 out of 5 stars
i9 14th gen is the beast!","Just upgraded from i5 9400f to i9 14900k and super happy with the performance that I am able to achieve. It simply works buttery smooth. Large applications open like notepad apps.It heats a lot though so I went with MSI coreliquid liquid cooling solution.If looking to upgrade from 13th gen then save money because the performance is identical, however if setting up new PC then definitely go with it.My setup -MSI MPG z790 carbon wifiIntel i9 14900kMSI RTX 4070tiMSI MAG coreliquid liquid coolerSamsung 980 Pro - 1 TBRipjaws 32gb ddr5Bonus tip: If u are struck setting up ur PC then go to MSI support and they are super responsive to assist you.

Ich habe mich für eine hochwertige Wasserkühlung von NZXT entschieden (Kraken 360 Elite), um die Temperaturen im Griff zu behalten. Mit dieser AIO bleibt der Prozessor auch bei intensiven Gaming-Sessions oder langen Renderzeiten kühl und leise.Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis:Der Preis des i9-14900KF ist sicherlich nicht niedrig, aber angesichts der gebotenen Leistung halte ich ihn für gerechtfertigt. Für Enthusiasten und Profis, die maximale Performance benötigen, ist dieser Prozessor eine lohnende Investition.Fazit:Der Intel Core i9-14900KF ist ein absolutes Monster in Sachen Leistung. Ob beim Gaming, bei kreativen Arbeiten oder beim Multitasking ? dieser Prozessor liefert konstant beeindruckende Ergebnisse. Die Möglichkeit zur Übertaktung bietet zusätzlichen Spielraum für Performance-Enthusiasten. Auch wenn er etwas teurer ist und eine gute Kühlung erfordert, bin ich rundum zufrieden mit meiner Wahl und kann den i9-14900KF jedem empfehlen, der das Beste aus seinem System herausholen möchte."
5,Arrived fast,Fast shipping. Works as advertised.
5,Excelente procesador top de lo top,"Lo compré con el 10% de descuento, es el mejor procesador que he tenido. No llora con nada, que es muy caliente, si. Pero con una buena refrigeración liquida, que ya son bastante buenas, se controla.Me gustó mucho, sin demeritar a la competencia AMD que lo está haciendo genial también. Per en mi caso como las memorias DDR5 vienen optimizadas para intel y no quiero estar batallando, me decidí por este y no me arrepiento de mi compra. Muy buen producto de calidad premium."
5,Fast,Used for 3D rendering. Solid and fast. I am very happy with this cpu.
1,Horrible Efficiency,"overall intel is great for a work station, HOWEVER the 14 series is stupid as hell... it offers NO benefit in 99.9% of situations over 13 series... I upgraded from a 12700k, and saw only minor improvements, and at the expense of power cost. My desktop now idles at 150-250 watts... before with my 12700k it was idling at like half that. in most cases a lot of people wont care, however being forced to live in a high cost of living state like CA, where electricity is $0.44 per kwh, that means just idling is costing me 0.11 per hour, that's $1000 a year just in idling... plus all the electricity my house uses. I'm only here temporarily (military) and will be moving as soon as retire, but its something to note.On top of that, its a straight refresh of the older 13th gen, and they blocked APO for the 13th and 12th gen and aren't working on getting it working across the board (only minor useless titles no one honestly cares about)...If it was a bit cheaper to go AMD, I would have went to a 7800x3d, but that would have cost me about 900 just to switch, due to having to buy new RAM (still on DDR4, 3600mhz/CL14) and Motherboard...There's also the constant issue of certain games/programs just refusing to run in Multithread/Multicore, or using the E-cores inappropriately. Intel really needs to sort out this trash..."
1,BUYER BEWARE,I have written a couple of dozen reviews on Amazon and this is only my second negative review.  I placed an order for a brand new Intel 14700K CPU from Amazon and it arrived as an Open Box (the factory seal had been cut and the processor was jammed into the packaging at an odd angle.  I installed it in my system and it would not boot - did not even get past the POST testing.  I uninstalled it and send back for a refund with a note that it was an open box and was defective.I give this only a single star across all categories as the processor arrived in an open box (I paid full price for a new CPU) and did not work in my system (it was defective on arrival) - it's a month later and I still have not received a refund.  I purchased an identical CPU from another source and that CPU booted up with no issues (it is running the PC I am typing this review on) so clearly an issue with the quality of the product that Amazon shipped to me.
1,Would be a great CPU but mine defective but it still booted and acted fine at first.,"System booted  fine with 2 ram sticks installed and it appeared that everything was fine at first but after some time issues started to show up.  Unfortunately this did not happen until the 30 day return policy elapsed.  At first I thought it was the motherboard or RAM.  But testing of different RAM ruled that out.  Bios updates to the motherboard did not help the issue.  Putting in a known good CPU allowed the final test of the motherboard and original system RAM and that all passed which indicates a issue with the CPU.  Now I'm waiting for Intel RMA process to have them test the CPU again and hopefully replace it.  When I did not have issues, it was a fast CPU, very impressed with that, just wish this showed up sooner."
1,New Intel I7 was delivered with the open and taped box,Intel I7 processor was delivered with the open box and with tape on it. When I bought It says that the I7 was brand new. Very disappointed for the right price I paid for it.
1,"Re-packaged, broken CPU","CPU1 fails CPU Float test from Intel's diagnostic tools. This also never came with the signature Intel stickers, thus leading me to believe the item was repackaged after a return. I will be filing an RMA to deal with this as I wasn't able to figure this out inside the 30 day window"
1,Did not work,Failed CPU after only a week of building the pc. Came in a slightly damaged package but thought it would still be okay. Did not have enough time to return or replace because of the time that it took to troubleshoot the issue.
2,"2.0 out of 5 stars
It's just a overclocked i7 13700k",What's the meaning of having a new chip when it provides no generational uplift except only thing that is better than last gen is the hefty power consumption if ur fine with that this will work fine but I think ur electricity bill is gonna sky rocket 3 to 5 % uplift for 15 % more money is not worth it rather buy 13 or 12 gen with some ddr5 ram will help you more or else get r7 7700 will provide less like 10 percent for 50 percentage less power draw ryzen is just better when it comes to desktop processor in efficiency and value for money

3,Issues...,"I had tons of issues with this cpu. I returned it and purchased elsewhere due to Amazon not having a replacement option or any available at the time for prime shipping. The one that I have now works great, so it's a good product if you get one that works.My second gripe with this cpu is that it's basically just a refresh of 13th gen without the luxury of working out of the box with z790 mobos. You will need to flash the bios of your mobo."

4,Insane performance at a cost,"This processor is a speed demon. Gaming, editing, encoding, and whatever else you can think of, it can handle. The performance is there. The value for money is quite good too. Unless you really want top of the line, this chip effectively eliminates the i9 from consideration. 20 cores. 8P and 12E. Boost up to 5.6GHz on 2 threads. I swapped a 12600K for this part and I'm still kinda staggered at just how fast it is in heavily threaded apps. This is a perfect upgrade chip for somebody on an older 12th gen i5 or lower. I wouldn't consider building new with it however.There's a cost to this CPU though. Heat. And power draw. I have an Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360 AIO on this chip, and even with a sizable undervolt, it still throttles at around 230W running 100C. It feels like this chip is almost uncoolable. Unless you go full custom liquid cooling or something. I considered a large air cooler for this chip and I'm glad I went with an AIO. Buyer beware. This thing runs hot. It's also incredibly fast. If you can cool it this thing will fly."
4,Hot in everyway,"Lot of power, enough for any game, especially if you add APO from intel but you need a good cooler because these run hot !Ps: also deactivate in your BIOS the auto tunning if you have an high end motherboard these are pumping insane volts and watts in the cpu"
4,Main improvement is lower power cost day-day,"I upgraded from an 8700k to this 14700k nearly 8 years later. Performance-wise, the difference is fairly negligible to me, and that is reflected in the 'real' specs. Going from 6 cores to 20 cores isnt really a 3x+ increase when most of those cores are 'efficiency cores'. User benchmark puts 14700k as only being 47% faster than the 8700k, despite being 8 years and 6 generations apart.The main improvement from my point of view is the reduced idle/casual power use. My UPS tells me that for my 8700k/1070ti system I drew ~0.43 Kw, and my new 14700k/4070ti super draws ~0.31 Kw watching YT, browsing the web (includes fans, monitors, etc).Mostly just wanted more balance for the new graphics card, since that's what does most of the heavy lifting these days anyway. AI image generation/training - GPU, video rendering/editing/transcoding - GPU, even audio processing/correction is done on GPU these days."
4,Works but not the most stable,I'm using this as a server CPU mostly for the SR-IOV capable GPU stability has been an issue when running windows VM's on proxmox but in light of recent news about mainboard MFG's pushing the CPU too hard out of the box that may be the source of my stability issues as I mostly left the settings OOB for the CPU
4,"Results are high, like the price!","I was never a fan of Intel's business models of locking off cores/features to try and upsell the features back to the consumer.......That aside, Intel has always been the leader in the CPU market and while AMD has been making strides in recent years Intel is still the go to for reliability and power.Anyway.... if you have money to burn and need to upgrade due to artificial obsolesces that is the new craze of forcing people to upgrade.... well, this processor will last a long time... or until they just decide it's not capable anymore."
4,Goes to 100 c with 280 MM AIO cooler,THis is a power hungry beast of a processor..under load goes to 280 Watt easy.. had to set the power limits using intel XTU.. but idles at 30n-35 C while browsing and general use... Jumped from a I7 9700 K to this... can see huge difference in gaming else its OK !!
4,Shes a hot one,"I upgraded from a12700k with asus tuf z690 board and a arctic air 360 AIO. The 12700 K ran at about 50°C gaming.The 14700k runs in the mid 60s. The 12700k Cinebench score and  temp was 22600/71c. The 14700k was 32000/87c . Still below throttling, which is OK according to Intel . When gaming I only see maybe five frames per second faster at 2k res .this is a good chip. Dont get me wrong. with as many cores as this has, and the speed it should last for a long time, it far exceeds the needs of any. New or future games."
4,Gets Hot Under Loads,"Undervolt for best performance. Dont get me wrong, its a very powerful processor. However theres typically a lot of heat associated. Without undervolting, hitting its 100 degree Celsius cap is easier than it probably should be."
4,Intel has a long way to go.,"To start, this is a great CPU. I consistently maintain 5.4-5.6 GHz without entering overclocking territory. I paired it with an MSI Suprim X 4070ti, and they destroy 1440p together. However, this is obviously a refresh and NOT a new generation. Performance gains are limited and to get there they raised TDP and thus it runs HOT. I have a 240mm AIO and its.. fine. It's just disappointing that this is how Intel responds to competition. This is a missed opportunity. A very good CPU but with both GPU and AMD CPU's getting leaps in generational performance this was disappointing."
4,"Stable, fast and great!!","Greaaaaaat, but lacking in presentation."
4,Decent upgrade over I7 8700,Upgrade from an I7 8700 to this. Temps are crazy when gaming but my water cooling setup helps keep it mostly stable.
4,It's a hot one,I had to replace my h60 to get this to run a full benchmark without hitting thermal limit of 100c with no OC. That is under full core usage during 30s intervals.Now that I replaced the cooler with an artic cooler with some kryonaut paste I have it running 5.6 all core with dual core at 5.7 and it maxes out at 87 on furmark

Beast gaming ????",Beast gaming world 2nd most powerful processor my set up has this processer and RTX 4070 16gb ram 2048gb(2tb) nvme m.2 ssd 850 watts pls buy it
5,The only real upgraded 14th gen part,"I was using a 10700K. I decided it was time..well, actually I got the itch.I decided to go with the 14700K for a few reasons. One is that it's the only 14th gen part from Intel that got a significant upgrade (four more e-cores and 8 more threads, plus a small clock boost).I also don't like that the 3DFX part from AMD had caused some minor issues for people, and I definitely don't like the RAM issues I see all the time on AMD systems. If it wasn't for the RAM issues, I may have gone AMD this time. Out of all the Intel systems I have assembled for customers over the years, I have not once come across a RAM issue that wasn't caused by bad RAM.This CPU is working perfectly, and gaming excellently. Gaming benchmarks show it to be a very good CPU, and I am not having any issues with it.If you are interested in any other Intel parts, I suggest going with 13th gen as you will basically get the same part for less money. For an i7 system though, this is an excellent CPU and a half decent upgrade over the previous gen."
5,"She's a beast, but so HOT!!","I guess everyone is right, these things are hot and then some.  I went with a off brand AIO, and for the most part I'm good.  It does get spicy when I'm rendering or doing some crazy multi tasking.Gaming seems fine, no issues.  I play all kinds of games, FPS, MMO's, survival, etc.  (Paired with a Gigabyte Gaming 4090 OC, Tforce 64 gigs 6000 M/T DDR5, samsung 990 pro NVME 2 tb x2, no OCing done by me.)I replaced a 5950x, which was having issues for some reason, just felt like it was getting slower and slower, thermal paste and heat were fine on it, never got over 60c with the beefier AIO I had on it.  Just took longer and longer to render things.  I guess I wore it out!I just think you'll want a good AIO, and/or a solid water cooling solution for this to really get the best out of it.  I'm not sure a air cooled option will do you any good, but hey I've been wrong many times, so there might be something that can handle the job.All in all, not bad, but it's not going to give you much performance boost over last gen, matter of fact I found out later 13700k beats it in a lot of tests, blargh!  Either way, its fast, and it runs everything great, so I'm happy till the next go around."
5,fast delivery,"Arrived earlier than expected, a very good Cpu. Expansive but what could we do."
5,L??uft,"Nachdem ich vor einer Weile auf einen 2k 144hz Bildschirm geupgraded hab, hat mein 9600k das Bocken angefangen und konnte in letzter Zeit nicht mehr die gew??nschte Leistung bringen.Hab jetzt seit ein paar Tagen dieses gute St??ck hier und was soll man sagen?? ein Rennpferd bester G??te.

5,Works,Does it?? job
5,Looks good,"Haven't installed yet but looks fine. Die size is 30x40 mm, meaning 0,3 ml/0,8 g is the perfect amount of thermal paste (not included). I'll put 5 dots."
5,i7-14700K is a significant improvement from i9-12900K,"I decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didn't justify the price difference, considering I was already getting about 1/3 more performance than my 12th generation i9. I wanted plenty of motherboard resources so I also bought the MSI MEG Z790 ACE, 32 GB of Kingston Fury 6400MT/s DDR5 and a 2TB Samsung 990 NVMe drive.Cooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9, even with a 360mm AIO cooler, so I went custom loop. Along the way I found a GPU water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling. The Thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators, but I wanted some disks, so I went for a 560x140 and a 280x140, both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans. Four more fans feed air into the case and there's till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged in.So what's the result? The processor runs at 85C worst case, and only two cores at that temperature. The fast DDR5 does make a significant difference. I initially ran it at 6GT/s then turned it up to 6.2 and finally 6.4. The last change is a 3.5% change in DDR5 speed and that gave me a 2.4% increase in system speed. I kept my old RTX3070 which used to run over 80C and now runs at 62C worst case. So despite more performance the system runs a lot cooler.I mostly run X-Plane 12, which runs the GPU and CPU very hard, continuously. After several hours the cooling water reached 36C and the worst core temperature was 85C. The processor just works. No stability issues with the standard settings on the MSI Z690 motherboard. There are three standard memory tuning options for 6.0, 6.2, and 6.4 GT/s and all work. This will do for me for a few years."
5,Chulada,La verdad es una chulada de procesador No me arrepiento de haberlo adquirido lo volveré a comprar las veces que fuese necesaria quedó genial con la computadora solo tuve que actualizar el bios de la placa base sin embargo por el resto su pan comido
5,En excelente estado,"El procesador llego bien empacado y con sus condiciones y funcionalidad excelente, cumple con todo; no tiene disipador de stock, pero hay tener en cuenta que para este tipo de procesadores es necesario un disipador de calor más eficiente que los que vienen en otros procesadores"
5,Best value for power,I was able to get 240fps in CS go and valorant without external GPU.I previously had 6th gen i7 and GTX980. And that couldn't pull this.Lightroom rendering is also good i am able to color correct 100 raw pics in seconds.I didn't expect this performance when i updated.
5,Simply awesome,Switching from a 5800x3d for my 4080 super.. this is one heck of a cpu. I only put a $60 280mm aio "I'd cooling" and put it on smart fan. After that gaming has been a breeze with crazy high fps that give me 99% GPU usage in every game. Jedi survivor is getting over 130fps with dlss quality on. Which is unheard of from everything I read. Totally glad I went with this over 7800x3d. Mobo was much cheaper with every bell and whistle I wanted. My newest build is definitely nice enough to leave any builder drooling.. Thanks to this cpu at its core.
5,Great Performance!,"Upgrading from a 10700KF to 14700K. Lots of forms posts are degrading this processor but Im here to tell you its well worth the money! Just make sure to go to your BIOS and limit the power to 253W. The whole heat of this chip is blown out of proportion. I havent gotten heat issues while gaming.Overall I have this chip paired with a 3090, while Ill wait for a new 50 series card.Some of the gains Ive gotten at @1440P, 45 in ultra wide 21:9, max graphics settings:Overwatch: overall 50fps gain, consistent 240hz capped out for my monitor.Black Desert Online: overall 35-40 fps gains.These are the games I normally play a lot and its truly notice when upgrading to this chip. Overall the computer is a snappy and fast and havent notice any hiccups. Really great chip and planning on keeping this for the next 4-5 years."
5,Intel Core I&-4700K desktop processor,This 14th generation Intel Core i7 is a powerful and fantastic processor for a desktop gaming build.The product is well packaged with some assembly instructions that are easy to follow.

5,"WoW, Powerful processor from Intel","WoW! What a beast, intel i7 14700K! it can handle any tasks in pc as game and everyday use.  No issues with it. Thanks for fast shipping!"
5,Very good and reliable processor,"Very good processor, upgraded form a very nice Ryzen 1700 (6 years old with me) to this one, decided to go intel due to memory stability. After 3 weeks I can say I love it, very nice temps while gaming and I've received around a 60% improvement in my games (I maintained my RTX3070). I'm currently using a NZXT Kraken Elite 360 AIO to cool it and it has been showing around 50-60 C during high intensive gaming which is very good. Went with this over the 7800X3D since I feel this is more future proof for productivity since I upgrade every 5-6 years. While I know the AM5 socket will last longer, anyways, every time I upgrade I also upgrade the motherboard. Very nice product, will recommend it."
5,Nicee!!!,"I never had a CPU on my hands before so i was really stressed out about it ð???, but i was able to mount it and it was the easiest part of my PC built, i don't have any idea about its perfomance yet and for now i just can say that in bios mode it keeps under 95Â°F with the AIO cooler, i will update eventualy when i finish the OS instalation"
5,Solid CPU,It's been great so far. Clocking right and no overheating. Currently paired with a phanteks 360mm AIO.
5,Worth it if <13th gen,Was going to wait until 15th gen to upgrade my 10900k but decided to go for it. While the 10900k is still a powerhouse this is a good upgrade and I am happy with. This processor is ridiculously fast and handles everything we would expect it to. Cyberpunk picked up 10fps with a 3080 but runs super smooth now at 4k with RT. I did pair this with a z790 Aorus and 32gb ddr5 6400.******** AT Own Risk*******  Suggest undervolting in bios if you know what you are doing. I am running this cpu 5.7 all cores - 1.24v on a custom loop. I see idle temps 31c - gaming 60c and cinebench 89c.  It will run hot if you're on air and do not adjust the default voltage. There are plenty of youtube videos out there as a resource.  Overall great processor
5,Top of the line,Potente procesador para mi configuraciÃ³n.
5,Love it,Super easy to install. Just update your motherboard bios to support 14 Gen
5,I7 14700k,"It makes a good pair with the RTX 4070 Ti Super, but you need a suitable cooler!  With Be Quiet Dark Rock 4 Pro I manage to keep it at 60 maximum 70 degrees in games!"
5,14th Gen + Asrock Z790 Steel Legend Wifi = Perfect in any Unraid server,"They say the intel 14th gen chips run hot. If thats true then the AMD Ryzen 7 3700x's run as hot as the sun because this chip is cooler than the AMD chips.It does draw a lot of power, but it has like 20 cores. Totally worth it."
5,Great Performance,Built a new system with the 14700k for photo/video editing and some gaming. Decided to go with the 14th gen i7 instead of the 13th gen since it's the only series that had a noticeable improvement (4 more e cores and threads). Very fast for video editing and overkill for most gaming. Absolutely love it! I keep it cool with a 360mm AIO and a contact plate for even lower temperatures.Avg Temps:100% Load - Low 70'sGaming - Mid to High 40's (Low 50's for more demading titles)Idle & Browsing - Mid 20's
5,20 modern cores per $400,"I bought it to do computations on all cores. The best value for money I could find. Requires custom loop, delliding if you want to run high boost on all cores for long periods of time. The chip is hot. I will probably drop boost clocks and undervolt to stay cool. Using Acrtic Freezer II 360."
5,"Good CPU, no issues","Upgraded from a really old CPU. It was basically between the 13700k and 14700k, and for a little bit more, I thought why not just get the 14700k. If you're on a budget, then just get the 13700k. There's probably no noticeable difference. It may not be the most efficient CPU, but it just works."
5,Fantastic CPU for the price.,"The media could not be loaded.
                



I decided against the i9 because of cost difference.  For my normal usage I use less than 2% of this CPU.  But I'm really happy with the speed and performance."
5,Good,Good!
5,Fast!,I upgraded from an 11900k to this. Huge gains! Pair it with decent hardware and you got a 1440p champ.

1,"until the kinks are worked out, not even a little bit worth the price.","I have had soooo many stability issues it is unreal.  I originally purchased the i9 13900k, did no overclocking but had soooo much trouble with the system that I stupidly replaced the mainboard and video card.  I didn't refund as I assumed that I had done the damage.  Literally months of troubleshooting and doubled expenses before I realized that the asus mainboard defaulted to super high wattage and the chip itself began to degrade at an extremely fast rate.  Yet again assuming that I must have done something wrong I ordered this replacement chip, to find issues suddenly occuring again.  This is about when the news dropped on mainboard suppliers and intel passing the buck on an inherently co dependant series of faults that have personally cost thousands upon thousands of dollars.I'm an IT professional, have been in the industry for more than 20 years, and have never encountered a situation so costly for the end consumer.I really hate to say it, I hold stocks in intel, I've loved them as a brand and considered them to be a number one choice, I can no longer say this.I honestly think there should be a class action lawsuit over this chip and it's predecessorI had to purchase 2  rtx 4090 and 2 asus mainboards before I could even lock down this issue.I hate to say it but if I'd gone with a competitor I would have saved multiple thousands of dollars."

Now it barely goes one ir two minutes before freezing and a BSOD. Now I'm doing ASUS BIOS MemTest86 so far so good (for the RAM).While Windows 11 Pro was working I did the Memory Diagnostics and it said it passed. So either the CPU or the Motherboard is bad.New ASUS Z790 Strix, with new Intel i9-14900k, with new T700 2TB Gen5 PCIE 5 NVME M2, and new 64GB DDR5 6400 RAM, with Runs Windows 11 Pro. All drivers up and Windows are up to date.I've not done any overclocking or XMP in the bios to push the RAM 4000Mhz to the advertised 6400. I avoided buying RAM that can go 8000Mhz with XMP because there are so very many failures with those--and I wanted 8000 because I wanted a system with no bottlenecks as much as possible.Runs great for about 5 to 30 minutes. Temps run from 30s to 50s to high 80s bouncing up and down like normal. Then BOOM BSODs.I will do tests including memory, cpu, and double check drivers.Most websites point to a CPU issue. Some mention RAM or drivers.I'm either going to solve this issue or return this i9-14900 CPU and replace it with an i9-13900.I hope to remember this review and update it with success info."
1,BEWARE of the New LGA 1700 Socket,"I've been a lifetime Intel diehard fan but man they really pushed a disappointing product out. This thing gets HOT, I've been building computers for a while but I've never seen a CPU regularly spike to 100 C with liquid cooling. My previous 8700k ran great and was fulling overclocked to 4.8GHz and I never saw anything higher than 78 C under 100% load. I was so sketched out by seeing the 14700k temps that I ran Intel's CPU diagnostic software and I couldn't even finish it! The temps got to a steady 93-100 C while testing so I had to cancel it and let the CPU cool down.I even tried some gaming with it and while playing Helldivers 2 at ""High/Medium"" settings It liked to hover at 95C and spiked constantly. This caused thermal throttling and game stutters followed with it. Even while at the desktop fully idle my temps would spike around from 25 C all the way up to 70 C. The reason for this is the new LGA 1700 socket ILM, you have to buy, replace, and correctly torque a WHOLE new socket brace just so you can kind of tame this CPU.I remember when Intel was known for keeping cool and AMD for getting hot. That's not the case anymore and I'm so disappointed because Intel was my go to with every single PC I ever built."
1,Series known to have issues,"The 13th and 14th gen intel cpu chips are notorious for being unstable and low quality. While installation is easy, the chip may come with deficiencies that get worse over time.For the first couple months after install i would experience BSoD crashes and i was trying to diagnose. Now 2 months later the computer will no longer boot without BSoD. All other hardware has been replaced meaning the chip is absolutely the issue. Currently in the process of RMA negotiations with intel because diagnosis took longer than the amazon return window. So far their service has been slow to respond. Until intel admits to the faults in these generations and offers an actual fix i would suggest sticking to AMD. I wish i had.I personally never overclocked the card, never had the chance, it wasn't very stable on default settings. Had a ticket with intel since 3 days ago, they havent reaponded in 2 days. Buyer be ware..."
1,No era nuevo,"El producto era de importación, entiendo que pudieran haber abierto la caja, pero llegó incluso con restos de pasta térmica, por lo que debió haber sido usado o era uno que regresaron. La incógnita de no saber que tanto estrés se le metió al procesador antes de enviarlo es complicada, cuando se esperaba un producto nuevo.Actualización: El procesador en efecto venía dañado, el primero problema fue que impedía la instalación de Windows. La forma de verificar la falla fue entrando a la BIOS y desactivando todos los cores, a posterior fui activando uno por uno. Con un solo núcleo permitió instalar Windows, el resumen fue: todos los E-cores funcionaban, de los P-Cores estaban dañados el 4, 6 y 7 ya que al encender cualquiera de esos tres desde la BIOS, generaba pantallas azules, se freezeaba o cerraba programas aleatoriamente.No descarto que el tema haya sido un problema de fábrica, pero desde que llegó con pasta térmica en los bordes, me hacía sospechar que había algo malo con el procesador, ya se realizó la solicitud de reembolso."
2,Poor Silicon Samples,The one received was a silicon lottery loser that required excessive and abnormally high voltage and had horrible SP-ratings. It was returned because the poor silicon quality made it unsuitable for the purpose for which it was purchased. I purchased a 14900KF from Amazon to replace it and it was equally poor quality and had to go back. Intel needs to cull their trash samples and sell them at a lower price. A CPU that needs 1.500V to run stock turbo clocks is unacceptable and impossible to properly cool.
2,Gets uncontrollably hot,I have this CPU on an ASUS z790 Hero MB with a H150i 360mm AIO cooler. This cpu temp spikes and throttles like crazy under high load. Using Thermal Grizzly paste as well. I have built competition systems for over a decade. This is not normal... Been following the online "declocking" and "undervolting" and that is unacceptable.
2,Can't overclock with thermal throttle,"I've got an Arctic freezer II, and direct contact place to try and cook this thing off but it's too hot. I had the underclock the voltage for my CPU in the BIOS to get this thing to not overheat while exporting Adobe videos. Intel missed the mark here and I'm pretty mad I can't return it. It works fine doing normal tasks, and gaming, but when I want a 3D render something or encode/export a video then it will thermal throttle at 100° C with fans at max speed. It literally spikes up to 100 in like one second."
2,Smh,"I was thinking, i am building my first major rig and wanted a beast of a processor. Wiff. this thing has the stability of someone on a unicycle on a tramploine. somedays its all good, others.. well i think you can imagine."
3,Possibly better memory support than i9-13900K,"Once they came down in price, I did get a i9-14900K as an ""upgrade"" from a i9-13900KF to  i9-14900K .  It's OK but I can't rave over it.  It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky.I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.  On the morning morning after, I had buyers remorse, tried to cancel but could not, so instead, I refused the package.  It took literally 6 months to get a refund.  That was rather irksome."
3,"Regret, should have go AMD","Because of the crash problem and we are told to turn down the performance in the CPU, We are not getting the performance we paid for. INTEL is saying it's the motherboard, and the motherboard is saying it's INTEL. we are not getting what we paid for, I think they should recall and give us a refund ð?¤? what a waste."
3,I finally lost,"I've built computers for more than 20 years, and I have never in my life had so much trouble booting with stock bios settings. I think I finally lost the silicon lottery. Using an Asus mb, I had to go into bios limit voltage and manually tune each pcore. Temps were wild and out of control 100Â°c, clock speeds were low thermal throttling, random crashes, blue screens inability to run simple programs without them crashing and shutting down. Tried intel xtu auto overclocking, ai suite, and asus ai overclocking via bios.. none of that worked. Had to just dig into bios, set limits, and manually tune each core. Now system is stable and solid. Been benchmarking and stress testing for a few days now. Temps are great, and I am happy. Not sure if mb is culprit, gonna get another board and test the chip. Just be ready for some trouble. Looked over many forums of others having the same issues."
3,"Great when I first received it, then an update to the ME engine nerfed it.","I was really pleased with this processor in the beginning, was running it at 6.1Ghz as a daily driver and even 6.4Ghz. About a month or two in to owning it they released an Intel Management Engine update for this processor and that was it no more overclocks. Every game would now crash if the processor was overclocked. I am tired of playing cat and mouse with Intel, won't be buying a processor for a while until things drastically change."
3,Thermal throttle spikes not present with 13900k,"My 13900k never thermal throttled in any game, yet I'm getting thermal throttle spikes when playing games like Cyberpunk with the 14900k. My 360 AIO mount is not the issue, as temps hover around 90-93c when stress testing at 253w. I'm also using a contact frame. I'm thinking the issue might be the increased voltage at the stock 5.7 all core frequencies, because my power usage has increased a lot while gaming. Whatever the case, I'm not the only one seeing this behavior - it's unacceptable.Update: Reducing the e-cores to 4.3 helps significantly, and setting everything to 5.5/4.3 (13900k values) solves it completely. Simply too much voltage is being pumped into the chip at stock frequencies. I've set up a Thermal Velocity Boost profile where 80c drops to 5.6, and 90c drops to 5.5, with e-cores at 4.3... and the issues are basically gone. Ridiculous that this has to be done though."
3,"Amazon Leistung Top, Intel Leistung ok","Habe CPU bei Amazon gekauft und auch verpackte Neuware erhalten.Seitens Amazon 5 SterneZur Intel CPU. Die CPU Generation ist gelungen.

4,Ca décoiffe !,"Bon pas de surprise sur la puissance de ce processeur c'est un monstre de puissance !Point crucial : ça chauffe beaucoup ! J'ai du mettre un AIO en 420mm pour refroidir correctement le processeur.Deuxième point : ça consomme beaucoup ! Vous avez toujours la possibilité de régler au maximum sur 125 watts dans votre bios pour parer à cela (perte de 4-8 % de perf).Sincèrement, si vous êtes un gamer et que vous n'avez pas besoin de puissance brut tournez vous plutôt vers un i5, ca fera amplement l'affaire !"
4,"Fast, but unstable when overclocked.","I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.  So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core.  Disabled in BIOS now.Specs: Asus z290a Wifi II, Corsair 96GB DDR5 5600, Samsung 990 Pro, CPU Water cooled, 3080tiSo the ""K"" is basically useless for me at this point and don't see myself doing it manually as it's just not worth it to me.  That said, when stable, it's a very capable chip."
4,Packaging could be improved,"The processor is great and arrived sealed in good condition, however, the cardboard box had no protection and it could easily be damaged if it fell."
4,Good for price,"I'm definitely gonna upgrade later but this is handling itself pretty well with dragon dogma 2 to fortnite and everything in-between, only gripe is that there's no small arrow on the actual CPU to indicate where to place it on motherboard so if you tossed the packaging without looking you might be bit confused with orientation otherwise good."
4,Please note that the F in the 14700KF means NO iGPU,"Wanted to purchase the unlocked version of the 20 core 14th gen processor and saw that this was a cheaper option at the time. All the description says is that ""Discrete graphics is required."" It would be much more helpful by adding a line that says the F version stands for no integrated graphics card. If you're doing any kind of workstation work such as video editing, most software will take advantage of the processor having an iGPU as well and so I'm actually losing performance with this model version. I'll have to return the item to purchase the correct version without an F. I would give it a full 5 stars if it had the line explaining the F version."
4,Excellent performance for general purpose use,As a Gamer/Data Scientist/Programmer/Tinker I wanted a mainstream CPU built by a well established company. With Intel's i9-14900K CPU I have a top of the line general purpose chip which provides above average performance in all the computational fields I have an interest in. I only gave it a 4-star rating because I had hoped that Intel would have brought the 15th generation chips out in 2023 Q4 as they said rather than just the mobile chips.
4,Uno de mos mejores procesadores,Excelente procesador super rápido lo recomiendo a los todos los que quieran actualizar su computadora o armar una nueva  yo lo utilizo con la tarjeta de video 4080 super excelente combinación..
4,Arrived used?,"It arrived in a sealed package but it was stained and with a thumbprint on it. Looks like it might have had thermal paste removed? I'm not crazy about that because I paid for new, but it seems to work fine."
1,AVOID THIS PROCESSOR AT ALL COSTS / 13th/14th gen Intel i7-i9 issues,"Where do I begin... In between the stability issues this causes, the blue screens of death, the fact that you can't run even Minesweeper due to the problems this processor causes, the ""lack of video resources"" not caused by the GPU but rather by the CPU, the constant need for undervolting of a so-called high end chip, the overheating of the processor, the fact that Intel stayed quiet about this and STILL hasn't taken any action so far, that so many customers have been forced to ask for returns, or the fact that this was hushed for so long that it'll be a miracle to get a refund... Disappointment is still too light a term to refer to what went on with these processors. Honestly, this already falls within a product recall territory, and it's both a scam and an insult to every potential customer out there."
1,Defective from manufacturer constant game crashes because of power throttle issue.,Defective from manufacturer constant game crashes because of power throttle issue. Intel needs to recall this product and refund everyone.  I replaced every part on my new PC build only to find out the issues was this Intel CPU (amazon 30 day warranty had already expired by then).  I'm now having to wait for months attempting to get a refund from intel.  This is a well-known issue and Intel refuses to admit and recall product
1,A Carefully Engineered Nightmare,"I'm a game developer and decided to switch from AMD to Intel for my latest build. The amount of problems this CPU has caused me has cost me hundreds of hours of work. I've been building computers for over 20 years and this is by far the absolute worst component of all time. E cores will cause instability in almost every multithreaded application, clocking has to be severely limited to avoid blue screen of death, Intel Extreme Tuning Utility is borderline malware, and the high thread count is just deceptive marketing because 1/3 of the cores are laptop grade. It gave the illusion of stability through the return period so I'm now stuck with a $500 paper weight CPU and motherboard."
1,"Absolute scam, stay away!","This CPU is a scam. I spent four months debugging my new system, went through three motherboards, two sets of RAM and countless hours of debugging and trying, just to figure out that this CPU is garbage. I can't get my system stable, it keeps failing. This CPU is so overclocked that it does not run stable. Ever. Safe your money, times and nerves and stay as far away from this CPU as you can. I will never buy Intel again."
1,Lost me as a customer,"I?ve always used Intel, as my experiences with AMD have never been great. Wanted to upgrade from my 8700K as I?m doing a lot more rendering/3D work and I need the extra cores and performance. I thought I did my due diligence and picked out ram that was compatible with my motherboard, a suitable CPU cooler, etc to ensure a smooth upgrade.Ultimately was met with so much instability, crashes, high power usage and heat. The instability seemed incurable so I returned everything and switched to the 7950x3d? and it just worked straight out of the box, runs so much cooler and less power draw, with no crashes. It?s not as fast as the 14900k in my tasks, but the other benefits out weigh the decrease in performance."
1,Tribal packaging,Products work well but runs very hot. Tribal packaging tho the only Protection was a piece of crumpled paper. The cpu wasn't even in the packaging it had folen out and was just tumbling around the box when it arrived. luckily didn't have any noticeable damage though
1,Incredibly unstable,"Intel has pushed these 13th and 14th Gen i9's way too far in an effort to keep up with AMD. They come out of the box with maxed out settings, including a nearly unlimited 5000w (yes, thousand) available power draw. Intel customer support will ask you to manually configure the BIOS to a setting that effectively renders it a very expensive i7. Wait until they get this fixed, if it's even possible, unless you just really like underclocking and BSODs"
1,SO MANY PROBLEMS,This CPU is a piece of garbage. Can?t run most games without special settings that are all different from each other depending on the game. Don?t buy this worthless CPU. Was better off sticking with my 10th gen I7
1,Unstable Out Of The Box.,"Installed on an Asus Z790 Hero motherboard, the system was unstable when attempting to undervolt the CPU, and tweaking settings never stabilized it. Hopefully, Intel will release more stable silicon in their next generation."
1,Was a loyal intel consumer until this.,Brand new chip doesn?t even work. How?d are these for sale? Returned this. Amazon received this almost one month ago and still hasn?t issued a refund.
3,The heat is hot,Super hot CPU. Investing in this means investing in serious cooling for it.
3,Memory controller isn't that great,It's no secret that the memory controller is a lottery on this and 13th gen cpus. It's very flaky.7200mhz XMP profiles are unstable. 4 sticks of RAM is unstable.Other than that the CPU does its job. It's basically just a binned 13900ks. Nothing special.
3,Caja cortada con un cúter,"La caja tenía un corte de cúter en la parte superior, la verdad me molesta que haya tan poco cuidado con las cajas de productos tan caros."
4,A Monster CPU with One Major Caveat,"I built PC with the new Intel i9-14900k, and I must say, it's a beast of a processor. Coming from an i7-8700k, the performance boost is nothing short of incredible. Multitasking, gaming, and content creation have all seen a significant improvement. Multithreaded applications and gaming experiences run smoother.  It's a productivity powerhouse. The clock speeds are no slouch either, making it excellent for single-threaded tasks and gaming. The major downside of this CPU is the heat it generates. Even with a high-end cooling solution, it tends to run hot, and that's something you must take into consideration when setting up your cooling solution. Be ready for this CPU to draw a significant amount of power at full load. It can put quite a load on your power supply and might necessitate an upgrade if you're not already prepared. The Intel i9-14900k is an incredible processor, and the upgrade from an i7-8700k is substantial. Its exceptional performance in various tasks justifies its price tag. If you're willing to address these challenges, you'll be rewarded with a fantastic computing experience."
4,This is thing is super hot.,"May be a little excessive and unnecessary, but glad I got one when I did.  Sometimes these things get hard to acquire, especially at a decent price.Seems to run a little hotter than my Ryzen 9 7950X, so I went with dual 420mm,  If you buy this CPU you should really consider custom loops or large cases with 420mm AIO support."
4,"great cpu, not as powerful as I thought it would be","great cpu, not as powerful as I thought it would be. Ended up going with a 14700k, just seemed a bit laggy even when running at  5.8 all core.. great cpu though and runs cool"
4,Recomendado!!!,Perfecto para las tareas más demandantes y los juegos más pesados en cuestión de rendimiento en pocas palabras perfecto para gaming y programas pesadosSe lleva muy bien con una RTX 4090 24 GbPiénsalo bien en cuestión de rendimiento
4,Fast and Lots of Cores,"I write code for a living and this CPU builds my code 5.7 times faster than my prior (6th gen) development machine.  I'm really happy about that.  Plus it can run 32 concurrent threads which means I can easily host multiple VMs.  Nice!  Only downside of this CPU, for me, is no VROC (RAID in CPU) support."
5,Processore eccezionale,"processore al top, davvero stupefacente.Non a buon mercato, ma se servono prestazioni questo è il processore giusto."
5,El mejor procesador del momento,"Muy buen procesador, pero necesita una buena refrigeracion."
5,Running air cooled on DeepCool Assassin IV with ease,"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen."

5,6.2GHZ 8200mts cl38 Daily Driver.,"This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailers?Best Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fans?Avoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans.

Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options.

Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methods?increased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this date?4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.  Just having fun, do what you love!I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar!Note:Settings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours.

5,Klasse Steigerung vom 12900kf !,"Der Intel i9-14900K ist eine beeindruckende Weiterentwicklung des i9-12900KF.Der spürbare Leistungsanstieg, den ich erfahren habe, ist beachtlich und zeigt die Fortschritte in der Technologie.Die Kombination mit der Asus Apex Encore und dem schnellen 7200 MHz Arbeitsspeicher liefert super  Ergebnisse, immerhin  konnte ich 41.000 Punkte im Cinebench R23 ohne Übertaktung erreichen.Die Kombination bietet eine solide Grundlage für anspruchsvolle Aufgaben und Gaming.Man sollte jedoch beachten , dass die genaue Leistung je nach Anwendung variieren kann.Insgesamt scheint der i9-14900K eine lohnende Investition zu sein, selbst wenn man vorher im Besitz der 12. Generation war."
5,Powerful but Warm,"Before you purchase this CPU please also purchase alongside of it purchase a 360 AiO as well, this CPU is in need of it. I'm not trying to say that to scare you but it runs warm. In my (asus) bios I turned on ""Disabled-Enforce all limits"" so that the motherboard doesn't try to do on the fly OC to keep temps low and stability up. I haven't had any crashes or stability issues at all. I did a full platform upgrade from the 10900k to this, I kept my RTX 3080 and the performance bump was actually fully noticeable. I'd say my average temperature for doing basic computing is around 37c with my Lian Li Galahad II Trinity 360. It's a monster of a CPU genuinely and if you are in the market for an upgrade don't hesitate you won't regret it."
5,El GOAT,"De los mejores procesadores del mercado. Excelente para cualquier tipo de tarea exigente. Pero es importante combinarlo con una buena refrigeración líquida o tendrá cuello térmico.Tuve que pedirlo 2 veces porque el primero tenía un error de hardware muy común en estos procesadores, un problema en la compilación de shaders que crashea en algunos juegos o programas. El segundo que pedí llegó sin ningún problema."
5,Best cpu,"The Intel i9-14900K delivers impressive performance with its high clock speeds and advanced architecture. It excels in demanding tasks like gaming, content creation, and multitasking, offering smooth and responsive performance. The integrated graphics are decent for light gaming and multimedia tasks. However, it's power-hungry and may require robust cooling solutions. Overall, it's a top choice for enthusiasts and power users seeking uncompromising performance."
1,Died after 4 months,"It's fast, but it's not great for quality"
1,Windows install wants a network but no network is listed,"While you are installing windows, when you get stuck on finding a network but no networks are listed and it won't let you continue. This is because Windows 11 doesn't support your built in LAN/Wi-Fi drivers.The solution for this is to hitShift? which will bring up the command prompt window. From here you typeOOBE\BYPASSNRO which will re-enable the ""I don't have internet"" option.This will let you continue installing windows.Now you can troubleshoot your network from windows."
1,Not sure what CPU I received,I received a processor in an Intel I box.No markings on the processor itself. Thermal paste residue still on the processor.  This is crazy!!!
1,Inaccurate listing,"The listing for this product claims that you don't need a discrete graphics card. This is incorrect, the KF model does not bring an onboard graphics card. This wasted my time and slowed down the timeline for my NAS build by 3 whole days. Thanks."
1,"Trash quality control, trash memory controller","Quality/silicon control on 14700k is chaos. What the hell intel thinking and doing I dont know.My 13600KF took 7400mhz ram like champ, while this thing cant get even 6800mhz stable... Very dissapointed.1.35v 300w in cinebench with 100c temps with arctic freezer 280mm (that beats most of 360mm AIOs)  bending corrector and good paste.TRASH."
1,Do not buy,This thing is a total scam from the i9 13900k or kf. It? literally the same thing. The advertise that its goes up to 6000hz but that? only on two cores of course and only when you don? need them do they go that high. I had higher cinebench scores on my i9 13900kf then I did on this processor. It? the same thing just overclocked out of the box. Save your money
1,Faulty,Faulty cpuThey aren? properly tested before shippingPc booted into windows but couldn? handle any intensive tasks unless a dedicated gpu wasn? installed
5,Excelente Producto,"Me llegó en perfecto estado, el procesador tenía escrito exactamente lo que pedí: i9 14900KF. Llegó rápido y bien empacando."
5,IF YOU WANT THE AIR COOLED OPTION,"I'm not going to go over the same performance reviews others have done, yes its very fast for only $550 its the king of the poor mans build PC. my last PC its replacing was a $1000 10980xe and looking at the numbers the 14900k in average is 70-77% faster than the 10980xe. the only disadvantage between the 2 was the 10980xe had 48 PCIe lanes and ran 32c to 56c hot.i can't say the same about the 14900k heat, its spreader is almost half of the 10980xe. you can't just simply add a stock cooler or a ""MC'watercooler"" and expect the problem will solve itself. this is the first CPU in my 26 yrs of building PC's you have to plan out your cooler set up.ever since a 2012 water leak from these Mc'watercoolers (all in one 2 fan radiator kits sold by name brands) Ive never trusted them cost me $1500 in damages. The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I'll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen.here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores1. Noctua NH-D15 chromax.Black | Dual-Tower CPU Cooler | 140mm | Black2. Noctua NF-A15 HS-PWM chromax.Black.swap (this adds a 3rd fan for the air cooler you'll need it)3. FDXGYH 4 Pcs CPU Heatsink Fan Buckle PC Mainboard CPU Radiator Fan 12CM Wire Buckle Upper Hook Type Fixing Clip  (these buckles are compatible with noctus 140mm fans)4. Easycargo 40mm Heatsink Kit 40mmx40mmx20mm (this you place on the flat base of the noctua cooler will help dissipate heat)5. Easycargo 100pcs Heatsink Assortment Kit Small Cooler Aluminum Heat (these you throw on the back of your mobo on and around the mount brackets you'll me amazed how adding heat sinks on the back of the mobo will reduce temps)6. Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut (this is the best thermal grease cooler by 1-2c cooler than artic silver mx 6)7. Thermalright Intel 12th/13th Generation LGA1700 Anti-Bending Buckle ( a must add a little thermal grease on the cpu side flaps this buckle is 100% aluminum will al help dissipate heat.then i went to my mother board software options (mobo is an MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX) select ""CPU cooler tuning"" select ""tower air cooling"" which will limit the wattage draw to under 300w also note if you are not using a Water Cooling Reservoir  you should also use this option, water cooling a 14900k and OC really does require a reservoir, and a 4x 120 fan size radiator if you're simply using a pre-built 2x fan radiator its not enough to handle the 14900k and the CPU is known for drawing 370w plus!!so using air cooled i got a 2371 score with no watt limiter option an temps were 78-100c on the p cores, and with the 300 watt limit the score was  2328 with temps 70-99c never hit 100c case the limiter would kick in. (note this is from CPU testing that punishes the CPU realistically i don't see this CPU going over 88c even on the most demanding game in 3 years.i personally do not recommend OC this CPU its already been pushed to its limits by INTEL at best for another 100 watts when all you're getting is 3-4 more FPS and that's not worth it. and all these people bragging a 6.2-6.5ghz OC, there just flexing for clout, then they take the CPU back to default. i already have my P cores spiking to 6.002 at 288-300 watts, and under 99c temps; adding 0.198mhz will meaning nothing for apps and gaming.personal note the MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX Gaming Motherboard is absolutely amazing at squeezing out all the performance of the 14900k worth the $700 price never crashed during testing that 26 power phases is godly  compared to my last gen EVGA x299 dark had 12 phase...RIP EGA :("
5,I MADE IT WORK,This is something that a lot of people do not understand about processors. If you put too much voltage you are going to damage it. I want to delid it but I don't see the need and here is whyEven if I can get it 20 degrees cooler it will not matter It will still need 3.5 to 4.2 volts to stay stable at advertised speeds.I am running it @ 5.4 GHZ all P cores and this thing is unbelievably reliable . And maybe 10 seconds extra to render vs 5.7 to 6.0 GHZI get the point that ppl want to have the Bragging rights to say that it runs that fast but it will gwt damaged guaranteed 400 watts is a lot for that little unit. I think that 5.4 5.3 5.2 is more than enough specially when you have a total of 32 threads and gaming is practically single threaded . And most games are GPU bound. I only use it in the gaming department for Flight simulator and have not seen it above 68 degrees.I had a 4770 k and still running strong at 4.5 GHZ in a very small case.Intel is a beast and this I 9 is very good . Future proof for at least 5 years to come .Note. I have delided at least 20 cpus and the ones that got damaged were the ones that got a lot of voltage . They are very heat resistant but voltage just kills them .I have been running this cpu 24 /7 not an issueNot a blue screenJust underclock and undervolt and you are good to go This thing is a monster .
5,Much faster than my previous i7-6850k,"So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!"
5,Blazing Fast Performance with Intel Core i9-14919K,"The Intel Core i9-14900K processor is a beast when it comes to gaming and multitasking. With its 24-core configuration (8 Performance-cores and 16 Efficiency-cores), this CPU handles everything from intense gaming sessions to heavy-duty content creation smoothly and without a hitch. The unlocked feature allows for overclocking, providing additional performance boosts as needed. Integrated graphics are a great addition, capable of handling basic video tasks and supporting displays without the need for a separate GPU. This processor consistently delivers high speeds and reliable performance, making it a top choice for anyone building a high-end PC. Whether you're gaming at the highest settings, streaming, or juggling multiple intensive applications, the i9-14900K stands up to the challenge."
5,Killer Processor,"In 2020 I made the mistake of switching to AMD. The system I built was so annoying. The fan would increase and decrease speed depending on the load, and it literally made the processor wait for the fan--at least that's how it seemed. Slowed everything down and made a lot of unnecessary noise. With my new Intel-based system, those issues are gone, and I have a lightning fast PC. Learned my lesson about AMD!"
5,Outstanding Performance,"This processor has way better memory controller then my previews 12900k for my DDR4 clocking at 3950 MHz at 15-15-15-30 timing error free. I had heard about the 14900k has crashing issues so far I have no issues with Unreal Engine 5 games, Tekken 8, Battlefield 2042, etc, etc.... My cpu is running 59 GHz all P cores @ 1.35v limited power P1 and P2 @ 253 Watts, therefore, won't over heat and degrade the  silicon of my 14900k,  55° average temperature on gaming with a good cooler MSI MEG Core Liquid S360 - AIO at full speed push and pull fans. All my games runs extremely smooth at high frame rates with no stuttering."
5,Unstable at default oc settings on asus motherboard,Even running at the default 6.1ghz turbo settings the processor is extremely unstable and causes constant crashing.  Only way to stop it is to go in bios and set the core ratio to 57 max for power cores and 43 for efficency cores. Drove me nuts trying to figure out the problem for months also buy a hefty duty power supply if you're buying a 40 series rtx graphics card constant crashing of apps and games from lack of power to the graphics card from even a 1000 watt supply
5,Oh ya!,"It's a processor. It's like any other processor that processes, only better.It destroys video editing and processor intensive brush strokes in Corel Painter. It has no problem with any kind of processing you can throw at it.Runs hot and causes the cooler to spool up when playing poorly programmed games, but the water cooler is up to the task. Still, it reveals what games are just piles of trash code.Just remember to update your BIOS because it's still a relatively new processor. And stay away from Windows 11."
5,Powerful!,"I bought this as an upgrade from my trusty i9 10900k. I was worried the performance boost would be marginal but I was pleasantly surprised to get a solid boost on 1440p with my rtx 4080 super. Playing Helldivers 2, my fps went from mid 70s-90s to 120-140s at everything maxed out. Playing VR sims like il-2 and DCS has mostly eliminated little stutters and performance drops. Similarly, MSFS 2020 at ultra settings in populated areas provides a smooth and stable experience. My temps generally stay around 65 to 75 underload/demanding gaming. I have seen brief spikes to 80. I'm using an EVGA CLC 280mm cooler. I may need to reapply thermal paste."
5,Works great,My husband built me a computer from scratch because my old one was to slow for him. The I7 was the last thing I needed. It was easy for him to install. It performs fantastic.
5,Use a good cooling system - I've got it under a 240 AIO with Diamond paste,I upgraded from an i9 - 11900K.  Pretty good performance increase on benchmarks.  I haven't gamed on it yet (still in the process of locking down cables and loose hardware)MB GIGABYTE Z790 AORUS PRO X
5,Much fast,Able to compile rust code way faster now.
5,This is a Beast,"Case: GOPIE Micro ATX Case T07 (branded as ABIT on the case)Motherboard: MSI MAG B760m Mortar WIFI IICPU: I9 14900kCPU Cooler: ID-COOLING SE-207-XT SlimDDR5: 64Gb T-Team Create Expert 6000Mhz (4 x 32Gb)3 x m.2 Gen4: Lexar - 1 x 512GB (OS)/1 x 1TB/1 x 2TBSSD: 1 x 4TB CrucialCase Fans: Thermalright TL-9015B CPU Cooler Fan 92mm (2 x Intake Bottom/2 x Exhaust Top/1 x Exhaust rear)PSU: Montech Century Mini 750w GoldGPU: N/AThe I9 14900k is a beast and runs hot. While doing benchmarks, a few Pcores would hit 100c while others would hit 92c. Ecores was about 87c and low of 83c on 4.3Ghz all Pcore and 4.2Ghz all Ecore. Offset voltage was at 0.3. After switching back to auto clock, I still managed the same temps, but getting 5.1-5.2Ghz on Pcore and 4.3 on Ecore. If my case allowed 120mm fans, I would of most definitely installed 240mm AIO cooler. That for sure would of helped with the temps and get me higher benchmark numbers.When it came to rendering a 20 minute 4k video on sony Vegas Pro 18 (IGPU only), it took about 15 minutes to complete it vs my I9 9900k that would of taken over an hour to finish it (RTX 3060). This system was meant specifically VR/light video editing. So, considering how fast it is on the rendering without a dedicated GPU, I am pretty excited about it. I haven't tried the VR aspect yet.Overall, if you are coming from a few gen older CPU and want to upgrade to the 14900k, you wont be disappointed."
5,Fast and good,Ooohhhhh boy this is fast and secksy. Maybe the women will love me long time for buying mmmmmm boy Im insecure
5,Scores well with cinebench,Like the idea of no onboard video heating up the processor.  The irony is i have a Asus pro art MB 750 model that does the integration of components. My station is primarily used as a work station though it scores well with PC Mark 10 and cinebench. 3D Mark declares the obvious that I need to upgrade my video card from several years ago. The ai over clocking helps in the bench marking significantly. Lot easier to overclock than in the early 2000's on my core 2quad. Enjoying my thermal right air cooler it does a great job for half the cost of my older noctua cooler on my prior haswell i7.
5,AMAZING BEAST,AMAZING AND RECEIVED SO QUICK! <3
5,I9 14th Gen nest CPU on market !!!!,This CPU is a absolute monster.  Period.  i love it .  i have it paired with a 4080 super.  Any new game i can usually pull 300 fps on any game!
5,Even Microsoft was impressed,"I had some issues after install with Windows wanting me to buy it over again. While I was on with Microsoft tech support even they were like, ""that's a heck of a setup""..."
5,Better than 13th gen,"I previously purchased the 13th Gen version of this processor and it had a defect. Intel was very good at getting a refund sent via RMA, although it took awhile. I purchased this version instead and was pleasantly surprised to see all of my issues resolved. The CPU can handle almost everything thrown at it. Certainly a good purchase and better than the 13th gens that seem to have more issues."
5,Disgustingly Powerful.,"Words truly cannot express how powerful, but also how hot this cpu is. After upgrading from a Ryzen 3700x to this, my work speed, gaming, everything cannot lay a finger on this thing. The only time's i've seen this truly cap out is during extreme compression, decompression, and specific rendering situations. The only con which isn't truly a con is that this chip can get incredibly HOT. If you're going to get this? I would absolutely suggest a 360 AIO cooler or you're going to experience thermal throttling, or even thermal shutdowns. That was my original issue, but quickly upgraded coolers, and this thing is a MONSTER."
5,It's the perfect fit for this monster PC I just built.,"A lot of people are upset with the 14900k because of the minimal performance leap thar came between it and the 13900k. I say who cares. If you have a 13900k, don't upgrade, but if you have an older PC or 12th Gen, this is a worthy upgrade. I absolutely love mine. It's a monster of a CPU.I honestly don't recommend air cooling it. It can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits (which most people don't know how to do, let alone even know what that means)If you're not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k, I recommend you do what I've done to cool mine, you dont neeeed to, but it helps. I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator. That means I have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator, and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case. Both are blowing upward. It creates more airflow. One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap. It might say 12th/13th Gen but it will also work on 14th Gen. So get an AIO, setup a push-pull fan configuration and get a contact frame. It's helping my Temps significantly. I typically stay in the high 50's or low 60's during 4K gaming. This CPU draws a ton of power so you might see it bump up to 80° occasionally, for a very brief moment. (Maybe 1 second or less)"
5,GET THE 14700K,"I have used this for my build and 3 others, didn't realize what the F is for...Get the K, it's not much more and worth the extra. That being said, this beast will do everything you want it to do and more."
5,Powerful CPU!,"This CPU is POWERFUL! It ran smoother and was able to open/load programs much faster than my Ryzen 7 5700G. Had no issues cooling this beast of a CPU with a 280mm AiO. If money wasn?t an issue for me, I would definitely buy another 14900K just to keep as a little souvenir hahaha."
5,So easy to install a baby could do it!,"No more lining up pins, now you just make sure this thing sits in the way it belongs and off you go! I've had an H170i on it the whole time but it barely gets into the 40's when under extreme load. For the price, the 14700KF is the way to go imho"
5,Runs HOT - Get a good cooler!,"I paired this with a ""GIGABYTE Z790 Eagle AX LGA 1700 Intel Z790 ATX Motherboard with DDR5, M.2, PCIe 5.0, USB 3.2 Gen2X2 Type-C, Intel Wi-Fi 6E, 2.5GbE LAN, Q-Flash Plus, EZ-Latch"" mobo and TGDGAMER ""T-240MM Black ARGB Liquid CPU Water Cooling with 240mm ARGB PWM Fan, Temperature Display, Computer Water Cooling"". The Intel application used AI to tweak my CPU to squeeze out more performance, but under 100% load it will often thermally throttle and sporadically hit 100C. I am considering finding a better cooler to keep up with this racehorse."
5,"Seems fine, though I never got to use it.","Didn't get to use this because the motherboard I ordered with it was D.O.A. Not the seller's fault, of course. I ended up refunding."
5,very good,i like it
5,Very fast Cpu,Must have 360mm water cooler for this cpu it runs very hot fast! My 260mm wasn?t enough to cool it down at all while gaming!
5,bueno,por la compra del procesador decía que regalaban un juego  no veo ningún código de canjede resto Intel es Intel lo mejor del mercado
5,The beast! Be prepared to cool it!,It's the current Intel flagship desktop CPU.We had to upgrade from 120mm to 240mm liquid coolers for it.IMPORTANT NOTE: You may need to manually set the max power and max amps in the bios. There's currently an issue that causes them to be set to insanely high values (4096W) by default causing the chip to become unstable under heavy loads.
5,i7 14700k es bueno no calienta mucho,no calineta mucho pero utilizo un radiador 360 corsair
5,Lightening fast.,"My benchmark is almost at 14k now with without overclocking.nVidia GTX 1080, 65gb 6400 ram and 2gb PCIE5 SSD, Gigabyte Z790 Elite x wifi7 motherboard.I won't need to change this setup for the next decade or so like I did with my last PC.Worth the money, but you'll need the right SSD to go with it."
5,Can you say SCREAM!,"This is the first time I've ever went for it and got an i9. I usually stick to the i7. I am so glad I decided to take the chance because this thing screams. To think that I can also squeeze out more by overclocking is just insane. Every application I've ran is so snappy and responsive. Being an impatient human, this thing makes me happier every time I turn it on. Power and Speed are right where I like it. This chip is just so damn sweet!"
5,Great product!,"New, great product, came as described and very fast at the same day!"
5,Great performance,"This is an excellent, stable CPU. Care must be taken to keep it cool. It is a hot running CPU. To avoid heat throttling at 100deg Celsius in heavy duty gaming or testing, order a high end liquid cooler. For professional work and easy gaming a big block fan cooler will be just fine as it is much more quiet. To save a little  money, if at all, the I9-13900K will work just as well performance wise."
5,Thank you.,I love it.
5,So far so good.,"Sorta came from a 13900k but I gave that to a relative after their x299/i9-7940x system began to have issues. He bought a z790 board and was amazed how far ahead the 13900k is in comparison an overclocked Skylake-X processor. He fixed the issue with the x299 system, but he decided to stay with Raptor Lake. All of which is okay by me because that old 13900k had no overclocking headroom, and I could only undervolt it by 5mv before it became unstable. I was going to buy another 13900k or maybe the ks version, but I decided to wait for the 14900k.The 14900k I got on the other hand has some overclocking headroom. I already set all P-cores to 5.8GHz, while keeping the double-core Turbo Boost at 6.0GHz. I also set the cache to 5.2Ghz and it's completely stable. I was not able to raise the multiplier at all with my 13900k. Just happy my 14900k isn't a lottery loser.While the clock of both the 13900ks and 14900k are the same, the 13900ks has a cherry picked memory controller. If you're looking to do a ton of RAM overclocking then the 13900ks may be the way to go.... but that's not to say if you'd get a 14900k with a good memory controller. Both my 13900k and 14900k work with DDR5-7200 RAM with XMP set, and no adjustments to the memory controller voltages.If you're buying the 14900k off the get-go and building a new system around it, then I recommend pairing it with a motherboard that has the BIOS Flashback feature."
5,it works,Works - what else is needed?  a little expensive.
5,This is a BEAST and runs hot.  But that's OK!,"Even you're getting hotter temps despite having great cooling, it's normal for this CPU.  It's a beast.  I recommend using a triple-fan-radiator AIO cooler to keep this bad boy as cool as possible. And make sure to blow the hot air OUT of your PC case."
5,Powerful processor,"Not sure what more to say other than it's crazy powerful.  Make sure you have a high watt power supply to go with this and all the devices you plan to run with this.  And really don't go small on the CPU cooler.  This thing is good at figuring out when to throttle down.  You'll get it's best performance with a large aio water cooler.  If you can build your own water cooling system, better.Also, make sure your mobo manufacturer have  all the drivers available to work smoothly with these lines of processors."
5,Well packaged and performed perfectly,"No issues with this seller or product, but for those that are looking for a new PC part the 14900 k is merely a refinement over the 13900k which you may be able to find cheaper."
5,Gaming God,"The media could not be loaded.
                



This beauty does exactly what it says, super fast overclocking her to 6 GHz run smooth."
5,Intel has made a really fast CPU,"I like the CPU because of the speed and easy install with no problems.  I use two 140 Cooler Master radiator fans to keep the unit cool. I totally rebuilt my computer with a Asus Rog 790Z board, 5 M.2  drives. I get a total boot up in 15 Seconds. I use the unit for Data, Video and music.  I've used intel chips and Asus Boards for over 30 years and never had a problem.  With this package I get instant access to all my files. Very happy with my purchase."
5,Excellent,"I had a minor hiccup with my new 14900KF, but I contacted Intel and their customer service was fantastic. They sent me a new one and it's working great now. This thing is like a buzz saw in gaming. I have a negative offset on the voltage of -0.0500v and the hottest I've seen it get was 62c while playing Horizon Zero Dawn maxed at 4K. It was getting as high as 190 FPS every now and then. This CPU is brutal man. Top flight customer service too."
5,Ultimate with 4090oc.,PERFECT!  EASIER to install than I thought as a first time processor install for me.WORTH WHILE performance increase from my (also good 12700). And helped unleash the power of my 4090oc GPU.
5,Perfecto,"The media could not be loaded.
                



Perfecto, es un i9 no se puede decir m?"
5,"Rock stable, Fast clock speeds, basically like buying the silicon lottery for a 13900K/KS","It's a Raptor Lake refresh CPU. If you have a 13900K you don't need this. Unless you are an extreme over clocker or need every possible MHZ per thread and stability. If you have a 13900KS you really don't need this CPU.If you have a 12th Gen, it might be worth it to you if you need that extra performance but really depends on what you do.If you are on 11th Gen or below and were looking to upgrade, you might as well get a 14700K or 14900K or KF as they are similarly priced with the 13th gen processors.Also, the 14700K has a 4 more E cores and higher clock speeds which can result in 10-20% performance gains depending on the workload compared to the 13700K.Otherwise wait for the next generation of CPUs to make the leap."
5,"Very happy with 14900K, the reviews are misleading. It's feels way better then they say it performs.","This CPU is amazing. Feels like magic. I have it running in an Asrock PG Sonic 700 series, with 32GB GSkill DDR5 7200, and a Crucial T700 2TB PCIe 5.0 SSD and Cooler Master Masterliquid Atmos 360. Anytime u do anything, even click a icon the cpu jump up to 6Ghz. And for me stay under 30C Idle and under 70C Max Load. Never mind what temperatures it runs at, I can't get it to throttle. Seems like all of its power is available on demand all the time. And I'm basically computing in Real Time. The 13900K was fast, significantly faster then the 12900K, and this CPU even though on paper it doesnt look like they did much, and in benchmarks it looks close, it still feels like 15-20% faster the 13900K when your using it. I feel like it runs cooler then the 13900K, the 13900K was the hot chip. I don't know how they do it. Like I said it's like magic how it stays at 6GHz and stays so cool."
5,It? a beast,Currently playing Battlefield 2042 with this beast and it? silk smooth even paired with a 1080ti
5,Highly recommended,"The media could not be loaded.
                



Works well on my new PC"
5,Ye,CPU runs at max 65 C. Seems good to me.
5,Powerful cpu for gaming,"Love the processor, got it new and using with a rtx 4090 for 1440p. Have it paired with a z690 formula board and I have the ai optimize the cpu. On a 420 cooler it gets 60c at best with warzone 3 with 240 fps. Fast and consistent,  on a 240 cooler Temps got up to 71-81c keep that in mind. Love my purchase!"
5,Hot,Runs hot but runs very well needs a good good good cooler
5,Can't argue with results,"Intel has always worked better for me than competition. I feel like reviewers benchmarks may not be realistic to a typical PC setup. I'm getting 620Fps at 1440P in Rainbow Six Siege on a 4090 ROG Strix OC. Yes at this framerate my fans do spin fast and are loud, but I limit the frames to 143 and then it is quiet and the fans hardly spin.Case: Corsair 4000DGPU : Asus ROG STRIX 4090 OCCPU : Intel Core i9-14900KPSU : MSI MPG A1000G PCIE 5 ATX 3.0Cooler : ARCTIC Liquid Freezer II 280Fans : 4x Antec PF12 SeriesStorage : 2X SAMSUNG 990 PRO SSD 4TB  870 EVO 4TB 2.5 InchMemory : 64GB 2x32 Corsair Vengeance 5600MHz CL40 XMPNote: I would not recommend the cooler for this case and MB combo Heatsink on MB blocks cooler which doesn't properly screw in totally."
5,Great Processor!,I build it my new editing PC and use this 14th generation processor (24 cores and 32 threads).
5,I like it.,Runs at a good temp with a kraken 360 elite.
5,Great cpu,"The i7 14700KF isn't just a CPU; it's a beast unleashed. This 20-core powerhouse purrs like a kitten under normal workloads, staying surprisingly cool thanks to its 7nm architecture. But don't be fooled by its initial demeanor  this CPU is a wolf in sheep's clothing, ready to tear through any demanding games and content creation tasks with ease, I paired with an rx 7900 xtx and forgot about frame rate drops and stuttering."
5,Great performance. Lots of heat,Great performance. Lots of heat.
5,High TDP and Temperatures,"A very powerful processor, but if it does not have good cooling, its functions will be limited. Currently it is working wonders together with the other components. But if they have a moderate cooling system, it is advisable to use the other brand of processors ""AMD"" that has half the temperatures, but with 10% to 20% less performance in some activities, and with the defects that come with not have an architecture that self-protects well or do not update its software often for better handling.Finally, I recommend the processor, only if you have a processor that does not meet current needs. My I7 6700k can do it all, but for some specific technologies, such as SSD Gen 4, peripherals with high-speed USB - C and others, it couldn't cope."
5,"Runs hot, get a good cooler!","Awesome CPU thing can handle anything and everything for at least my needs as a gamer, and programmer! HIGHLY SUGGEST getting a 360 AIO or a custom water loop, and a CPU bracket if you are getting this CPU. It run's very hot getting a CPU bracket cut down my temps about 5-10 degrees. I'm not sure how good air coolers are for this CPU but I've seen a lot of people not suggest it. I use a 360 AIO Loop and it works great at keeping this thing cool!"
5,Performs!,"Does as intended. Topped the stock benchmark stats. It's a heater but the I9s are the top performs. Recommend no smaller than a 360 cooler, I went Artic due to the increased width of their radiator core. Top temp (tuned) 95c but will play most games in the 65c range. VR put a greater heat of 91c max but the flight sim was beautiful and smooth as can be with water takeoffs and landings. This was an upgrade to a 12700kf that I chose awaiting the 14 generation processors. I have this combined with a Nvidea 4080 on a MSI z690 board with 64gb ddr4.  Smooth gaming."
5,Rápido y con buena atención,El producto llego antes de los esperado y en buenas condiciones. Lo cual se agradece mucho. Estare probando en los próximos días
5,Super fast,I really enjoy the speed of this processor. IO would definitely use this again on another build. Didn't rate the gaming because I am not a gamer but I would expect it would be great for that as well.
5,Careful shipment,Everything was great
5,"Great so far, one gen newer with no real improvements.",It was either this one or the 13th gen. I went with this one for the few extra bucks to stay up to date with things longer. Works great so far with no issues.
5,Very good CPU for work use.,"This CPU is for work use. It is very stable at stock speeds. It worked great right out of the box. I doubt if I will ever have to think about it again. I recommend it for real world use. As for gaming, I just can't say how it would perform."
5,Power,"The i9 14900K is undoubtedly a very powerful CPU!Just for gaming I wouldn't recommend, for gaming and working, YES!Also, think about a GOOD COOLING solution (custom watercooler, cryo,...) and/or undervolting (depends on MoBo).A regular 360mm AIO has a hard time keeping this CPU cool!"
5,"Aparentemente es un buen procesador, pero, no ha funcionado en mi placa madre","Este producto fue comprado en base a la información técnica de compatibilidad de INTEL y ASUS para la placa madre ASUS ROG Maximus Z690 Hero. Sin embargo, NO funciona, el sistema operativo no arranca. Se hicieron todas las pruebas sugeridas por ASUS, pero, simplemente NO funciona. Es más, se cambió a un nuevo procesador i9-14900KF y dió los mismos resultados, NO funciona. Aún estoy esperando respuesta de ASUS (2023-12-08). Si alguien tiene la misma placa madre y el mismo procesador, agradecería su sugerencia.Nota: la placa madre ASUS ROG Maximus Z690 Hero funciona perfectamente con procesador i9-12900KF"
5,"Great  buy, when on sale",This is a great processor and when on sale it is by far the best value out there!
